‚∏ª

Context
Repository: anyKrowd/TestX (public)
Branch policy:
	‚Ä¢	main ‚Üí production, protected (manual merge only)
	‚Ä¢	dev ‚Üí integration branch, auto-merge when CI green
Issues follow the Epic / Story pattern and contain markdown check-boxes for acceptance criteria.
Goal: keep board tidy, guarantee that every open Issue has a matching branch & PR, update progress automatically, and funnel all green PRs into dev so they can be tested together before a manual promote to main.

‚∏ª

Tasks for you (Cursor agent)
	1.	Audit open Issues
	‚Ä¢	Use the GitHub REST API or gh issue list --state open
	‚Ä¢	For each Issue without a branch, create one off dev using slug:
feature/<issue-number>-<kebab-title>
	‚Ä¢	Push an empty commit like chore: bootstrap branch for #<n> so the branch appears on GitHub.
	2.	Create or update PRs
	‚Ä¢	For each feature branch that lacks a PR, open a draft PR into dev.
	‚Ä¢	Title: feat(issue #<n>): <Issue title>
	‚Ä¢	Body:

Closes #<n>

### Checklist
- [ ] CI green
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met (see linked issue)
- [ ] Docs & .env updated


	‚Ä¢	If a PR already exists, ensure it points to dev, not main.

	3.	Mirror Issue progress
	‚Ä¢	Parse the task-list checkboxes in the Issue body.
	‚Ä¢	Whenever you push commits that complete tasks, update the Issue via GitHub API so the checkboxes reflect reality.
	‚Ä¢	If all tasks ticked and CI passes, move Issue to ‚ÄúReady for QA‚Äù label.
	4.	Automate branch ‚Üí PR linkage
	‚Ä¢	Add commit messages in the form fix: <desc> (#<n>) to trigger GitHub‚Äôs ‚Äúlinked pull request‚Äù section.
	‚Ä¢	Include Fixes #<n> or Closes #<n> in the PR body so merging auto-closes the Issue.
	5.	Continuous Integration gate
	‚Ä¢	Ensure every PR triggers the existing Playwright workflow.
	‚Ä¢	Configure branch protection on dev to require ‚úîÔ∏é CI before auto-merge (you can do this via GitHub API repos/update-branch-protection).
	‚Ä¢	After CI success, use gh pr merge --auto --squash to land it on dev.
	6.	Release discipline
	‚Ä¢	When dev is green and you receive the manual /promote slash-command from me, open a PR from dev ‚Üí main labelled release.
	‚Ä¢	Generate the changelog from merged PR titles since last release (git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --pretty=%s).
	‚Ä¢	Wait for my approval before merging to main.
	7.	House-keeping bots (optional but recommended)
	‚Ä¢	Enable pull-reminders: if a draft PR is stale for > 3 days, ping the assignee.
	‚Ä¢	Auto-close abandoned branches (no commits for 30 days) after notifying in Slack.

‚òëÔ∏è Unified ‚ÄúGit-Hub Steward‚Äù prompt ‚Äî v3 (includes latest CLI & release-note feedback)

Context snapshot (28 May 2025)
Repository: anyKrowd/TestX
Primary branches ‚Üí main (production, protected)‚ÄÉdev (integration)
Recent work:
	1.	Story 0.3 ‚Äì CLI Command Interface is COMPLETE (feature/4-cli-command-interface-implementation). CLI now exposes testx with commands run / create / setup / status and global flags --verbose --quiet --json.
	2.	System status command shows missing env vars for Slack, Notion, GitHub, and anyKrowd tenant config.
	3.	Release-note file names sometimes mis-match the Story number/version.
	4.	create command template bug fixed (page-object names).
	5.	.cursorrules file and docs need incremental updates after each agent run.

üèπ Mission

Maintain a clean, automated Issue ‚Üí branch ‚Üí PR ‚Üí dev ‚Üí main workflow and ensure our growing agent pack continuously records learnings (docs & .cursorrules).
Everything must be CI-green and traceable: every Issue has a branch & PR, every merged PR auto-closes its Issue, release notes match the Issue/version, docs stay fresh.

‚∏ª

üìã Tasks for you (Cursor agent)
	1.	Audit & branch
	‚Ä¢	List open Issues. For each without a branch, create feature/<issue#>-<kebab-title> off dev (push empty commit).
	2.	PR management
	‚Ä¢	Draft or update PRs targeting dev.
	‚Ä¢	PR body must include Closes #<n> and a Checklist block.
	‚Ä¢	Enforce branch protection: CI must pass before auto-merge to dev (gh pr merge --auto --squash).
	3.	Issue ‚ÜîÔ∏è PR sync
	‚Ä¢	Keep Issue checkbox progress in sync with commits.
	‚Ä¢	When all boxes ticked and CI green, add Ready for QA label.
	4.	Release-note discipline
	‚Ä¢	On each Story completion:
	‚Ä¢	Generate docs/releases/<issue-number>-<kebab-title>.md (exact Issue slug).
	‚Ä¢	Link the file path in the closing comment of the Issue & in the PR description.
	‚Ä¢	For each /promote (dev‚Üímain) release PR, compile changelog from these files.
	5.	Doc & rule propagation
	‚Ä¢	After every agent session, append new learnings to:
	‚Ä¢	docs/agent-changelog.md (chronological bullet list).
	‚Ä¢	.cursorrules (codified action rules).
	‚Ä¢	Commit as chore(docs): update agent learnings ‚Äì session <date>.
	6.	Service-env validation
	‚Ä¢	When testx status --global flags missing variables, open a Config Issue per service (Slack env missing, etc.) and link it in Story blockers.
	‚Ä¢	Provide .env.example diffs in the Issue body.
	7.	CI enhancements
	‚Ä¢	Ensure Playwright run uses testx run <module> <scenario> within the GA workflow.
	‚Ä¢	Upload HTML report artefacts on failure.
	8.	House-keeping
	‚Ä¢	Stale draft PRs (>3 days) ‚ûú ping assignee.
	‚Ä¢	Delete merged branches; auto-close no-commit branches after 30 days.
