# TestX Project Specification v1.0 (Enhanced)
**Project Codename:** TestX (Alternative: GuardX)  
**Company:** anyKrowd  
**Mission:** Fast, reliable, cost-effective end-to-end browser testing layer for CI/CD pipeline  
**Status:** Enhanced Draft Specification  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Contributors:** BMAD Orchestrator (Larry/Mary), Anthony (QA Expert)

---

## Executive Summary

TestX is a comprehensive end-to-end testing framework designed to provide anyKrowd's multi-app platform (ClientX, StaffX, AdminX, PrintX, CentralX) with automated browser testing capabilities. This testing layer is the prerequisite for enabling AI-driven coding and feature delivery while maintaining system reliability.

**MVP Approach:** The initial implementation focuses on establishing core testing capabilities and framework validation. Integration with GitHub for automated PR checks will be implemented in a subsequent phase once the testing foundation is stable and thoroughly validated. This phased approach ensures reliability before automation.

**Key Enhancement:** Based on QA expert feedback, this specification now includes advanced false positive handling, intelligent test versioning, and production-aware scheduling to ensure reliable testing without interfering with live events.

## Enhanced Network Chaos Testing ("Crapcon")

### Specific Connectivity Scenarios
Based on Anthony's feedback on specificity:

- **5G Slow (100 Mbps down, 50 Mbps up, 20ms latency)**
  ```typescript
  await page.route('**/*', route => {
    // Simulate slow 5G
    setTimeout(() => route.continue(), 20);
  });
  ```

- **4G Slow (10 Mbps down, 5 Mbps up, 50ms latency)**
  ```typescript
  await page.route('**/*', route => {
    setTimeout(() => route.continue(), 50);
  });
  ```

- **3G Slow (1.5 Mbps down, 750 Kbps up, 300ms latency)**
  ```typescript
  await page.route('**/*', route => {
    setTimeout(() => route.continue(), 300);
  });
  ```

- **Intermittent Connectivity (Random 2-5 second drops)**
- **Festival WiFi (Overloaded network simulation)**
- **Underground/Basement (Poor signal strength)**

### Implementation with ToxiProxy
```yaml
# ToxiProxy configuration for advanced network chaos
version: '3'
services:
  toxiproxy:
    image: shopify/toxiproxy
    ports:
      - "8474:8474"
      - "8080:8080"
    command: ["toxiproxy-server"]
```

## False Positive & Negative Handling Strategy

### Multi-Agent Validation System
Based on Anthony's insight about confidence scoring:

```typescript
interface TestValidation {
  testName: string;
  agents: {
    agent1: { passed: boolean; confidence: number; reasoning: string };
    agent2: { passed: boolean; confidence: number; reasoning: string };
    agent3: { passed: boolean; confidence: number; reasoning: string };
  };
  consensus: 'PASS' | 'FAIL' | 'HUMAN_REVIEW';
  humanReviewRequired: boolean;
}
```

### Validation Rules
- **100% Confidence Rule:** All 3 agents must achieve 100% confidence for auto-pass
- **Disagreement Protocol:** Any agent disagreement triggers human review
- **False Positive Detection:** Pattern recognition for common false positive scenarios
- **Learning System:** Track false positive patterns to improve agent accuracy

### Human Review Dashboard
- **Review Queue:** Tests flagged for human attention
- **Evidence Package:** Screenshots, traces, logs, agent reasoning
- **Decision Tracking:** Learn from human decisions to improve AI accuracy
- **Escalation Rules:** Critical path failures get immediate attention

## Test Versioning & Self-Healing Strategy

### Addressing Anthony's Self-Healing Concerns

#### Test Version Management
```
tests/
├── login-flow/
│   ├── login-flow-v1.0.spec.ts (stable)
│   ├── login-flow-v1.1.spec.ts (AI-generated improvement)
│   └── login-flow.meta.json (versioning metadata)
```

#### Self-Healing Protocol
1. **Change Detection:** AI detects UI improvements (not bugs)
2. **New Version Creation:** Generate `test-name-v{x+1}.spec.ts`
3. **Parallel Execution:** Run both old and new versions
4. **Human Decision Required:** Flag for version selection
5. **Specification Documentation:** AI creates impact analysis

#### Version Selection Dashboard
```typescript
interface TestVersionDecision {
  testName: string;
  currentVersion: string;
  proposedVersion: string;
  changes: {
    improvements: string[];
    risks: string[];
    impactAnalysis: string;
  };
  aiRecommendation: 'UPGRADE' | 'MAINTAIN' | 'UNCERTAIN';
  humanDecision: 'APPROVED' | 'REJECTED' | 'PENDING';
}
```

## Data Seeding Strategy

### Test Environment Management
- **Isolated Test Tenants:** Dedicated test environments per test suite
- **Data Fixtures:** Predefined user accounts, events, and configurations
- **Database Seeding:** Laravel Dusk integration for complex data setup
- **API-Driven Setup:** Leverage APIX for rapid environment preparation

- Multi-agent validation system operational
- Human review dashboard for test result analysis
- Event-aware scheduling for safe test execution
- Comprehensive reporting and artifact generation

**Framework Validation:**
- Validate multi-agent consensus accuracy
- Measure false positive rates in real scenarios
- Establish reliable test execution patterns
- Train team on testing framework usage
- Optimize performance and reliability

### Future Phase 2: CI/CD Integration
Once the core framework is validated and stable:

**Planned GitHub Actions Integration:**
```yaml
name: TestX E2E Testing (Future Phase)
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * *' # Smart scheduling

jobs:
  # Event-aware test execution
  # Multi-agent validation
  # PR blocking on consensus failure
  # Automated deployment gates
```

**Phase 2 Capabilities:**
