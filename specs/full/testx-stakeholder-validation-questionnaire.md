## Section B: Technical Architecture Validation

### B1. Multi-Agent System Complexity
**Context:** The specification proposes 3 AI agents validating each test with 100% consensus requirement.

**Question:** Is this level of complexity justified for anyKrowd's testing needs?
- [ ] **Essential** - False positive reduction is critical
- [ ] **Valuable** - Good to have but could be simplified
- [ ] **Excessive** - Simpler validation would suffice

- Are there simpler alternatives that would meet our needs?
- What concerns do you have about maintaining this complexity?

### B2. Event-Aware Scheduling
**Context:** System checks anyKrowd event calendar before running tests to avoid interference.

**Question:** Is event-aware scheduling a hard requirement?
- [ ] **Absolutely Required** - Live events must never be interrupted
- [ ] **Strongly Preferred** - Important but could have manual override
- [ ] **Nice to Have** - Useful but not critical
- [ ] **Unnecessary** - Manual coordination is sufficient

**Integration Requirements:**
- Is the anyKrowd event calendar API available for integration?
- Who owns the API and can provide access credentials?

- Does Anthony approve the human review dashboard design?
- What additional QA team members should be involved?

### C2. Manual Test Conversion Strategy
**Question:** How should we prioritize converting existing manual tests?
- [ ] **All Critical Path Tests** - Convert everything in the specification
- [ ] **Selective Conversion** - Start with highest-value tests only
- [ ] **Phased Approach** - Gradual conversion over time
- [ ] **New Tests Only** - Focus on new feature testing

**QA Team Input Required:**
- Which existing manual tests are most critical to automate?
- What manual tests are difficult to automate and should remain manual?
- How do you want to handle edge cases and exploratory testing?

### C3. False Positive Tolerance
**Context:** Specification targets <2% false positive rate with AI detection.

**Question:** What false positive rate is acceptable for your team?
- [ ] **<1%** - Extremely low tolerance (more complex system needed)
- [ ] **<2%** - Low tolerance (as specified)
- [ ] **<5%** - Moderate tolerance (simpler system possible)
- [ ] **<10%** - High tolerance (basic validation sufficient)

**Impact Analysis:**
Lower false positive targets require more complex AI systems and higher maintenance overhead.
