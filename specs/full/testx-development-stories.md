### anyKrowd-Specific Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### High Risk Stories
- **Story 2.1 (anyKrowd Multi-Agent Implementation):** Core system complexity with business logic
  - **Mitigation:** Prototype early with anyKrowd scenarios, frequent check-ins with Anthony
- **Story 3.1 (GitHub Actions + anyKrowd):** CI/CD integration complexity with multi-tenant testing
  - **Mitigation:** Test in separate repository first with anyKrowd staging environment

#### Medium Risk Stories
- **Story 1.3 (anyKrowd Event Calendar API):** External API dependency for event-aware scheduling
  - **Mitigation:** Mock API for development, clear interface definition with anyKrowd team
- **Story 1.7 (Payment System Integration):** Complex payment gateway integration
  - **Mitigation:** Sandbox environments for all gateways, comprehensive error handling

## Resource Allocation & Team Roles

### Enhanced Development Team Structure for anyKrowd
- **Lead Developer:** anyKrowd multi-agent system and core framework with business logic
- **Frontend Developer:** anyKrowd React testing framework and review dashboard
- **DevOps Developer:** CI/CD, containers, and anyKrowd deployment
- **QA Lead (Anthony):** anyKrowd test validation, review processes, business logic validation
