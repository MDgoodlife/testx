import { Octokit } from '@octokit/rest';
import { execSync } from 'child_process';

interface GitHubSteward {
  auditIssues(): Promise<void>;
  createMissingBranches(): Promise<void>;
  createMissingPRs(): Promise<void>;
  syncIssueProgress(): Promise<void>;
  autoMergeReadyPRs(): Promise<void>;
  cleanupMergedBranches(): Promise<void>;
}

class TestXGitHubSteward implements GitHubSteward {
  private octokit: Octokit;
  private owner = 'MDgoodlife';
  private repo = 'testx';

  constructor() {
    this.octokit = new Octokit({
      auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
    });
  }

  async auditIssues(): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation for issue auditing
    const issues = await this.octokit.issues.listForRepo({
      owner: this.owner,
      repo: this.repo,
      state: 'open',
    });

    for (const issue of issues.data) {
      await this.processIssue(issue);
    }
  }

  async createMissingBranches(): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation for branch creation
  }

  async createMissingPRs(): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation for PR creation
  }

  async syncIssueProgress(): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation for progress sync
  }

  async autoMergeReadyPRs(): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation for auto-merge
  }

  async cleanupMergedBranches(): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation for cleanup
  }

  private async processIssue(issue: any): Promise<void> {
    // Process individual issue
  }
}
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow
