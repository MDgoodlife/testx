The image illustrates the three main components of the anyKrowd platform: **Adminx**, **Staffx**, and **Clientx**.

- **Clientx** (left) represents the visitor or attendee-facing app, facilitating user interactions and payments.
- **Adminx** (top) is the organizer's backend interface, where event configuration, financial tracking, and data insights are managed.
- **Staffx** (right) supports on-the-ground operations, allowing staff to check tickets, process sales, and provide assistance during events.

The arrows show the flow of data and functions between these modules: **Adminx** configures and organizes event settings, **Clientx** enables user engagement, and **Staffx** executes the operations, with PRINTx and NUC supporting device functionality and printing needs. Together, they create a connected ecosystem for seamless event management.

# üì±üì±üì± Clientx 2.0

(the naming of our front experience visitor app)

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èGeneral

**Clientx** is the attendee-facing component of the anyKrowd platform, purpose-built to enhance event experiences through a versatile, user-friendly app. This app enables seamless attendee engagement with event services, offering a range of configurable functionalities that cater to varied event setups. With its core flexibility and adaptability, Clientx serves as a central touchpoint for all visitor interactions, tailored to deliver smooth access, transactions, and personalized content based on the event's needs. (This section should introduce Clientx‚Äôs power and configurability without diving into specific features, which are detailed below.)

### Web app

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/7a88ec8b-bec5-420a-9d15-1d4cbd670a7a/image.png)

AnyKrowd‚Äôs platform offers a web-based experience by default. The front-end view is, by default, available in a web mode on any device/browser. A web app is consistently accessible for essential functions, such as the (guest) wallet view for top-ups, especially useful in RFID-driven events. These wearables often include a QR code that, when scanned by a phone camera, directs users to the (web)app's (guest) wallet view. A web app can range from a simple top-up interface to a fully comprehensive application with all features and modules enabled (or not), depending on the event configuration.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/3c64c6a2-1c83-4389-8f0a-c19de9a6a775/image.png)

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/60794ada-c436-44e6-8d81-65688b1df078/image.png)

### Native app

The front-end app can also be released as a Google or Apple native app. Typically, this takes between 3‚Äì14 days to pass through validation and be published in app stores, complete with relevant screenshots and descriptions. A native app offers a more refined experience and enables additional functionalities, such as push notifications. Ideally, a lead time of 4‚Äì6 weeks is recommended to prepare and launch a new native app.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/9f1ddb06-40a3-4a4d-9cd4-1753fd306743/image.png)

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/77dc2a86-e88a-4b6c-a9fb-1302bdc3cdc5/image.png)

### Notifications

Native apps allow users to receive notifications, which must be enabled on the user‚Äôs device upon registration. Push notifications can be sent to all users or specific user segments. When a notification is opened, the app directs the user to the relevant content, and the view count for that content post is incremented by +1.

### Soft Update

Approximately every 2‚Äì6 weeks, anyKrowd releases updates to enhance platform features. Most improvements and new features are delivered through "soft updates" that do not require major structural changes. Web-based versions update automatically, while native apps prompt users with an update dialog upon opening the app. Once the update is completed and the app restarts, new features are accessible.

### Hard Update

Occasionally, anyKrowd releases a new major version of the platform that consolidates all prior soft updates and may introduce significant new features or changes requiring more extensive adjustments. A new native app must then be built and published in app stores. Although no downtime occurs, app stores' validation processes should be accounted for. Native apps typically auto-update between 22:00 and 06:00 if the device is connected to WiFi and charging.

## üëãüèºWelcome Screen / Login

The Welcome Screen is the first page users encounter in Clientx. Unless "public mode" or "full guest mode" is enabled, this serves as the main login interface where users can create an account or sign in.

Users can log in using:

- **Email** (manual account creation)
- **Social Login** options like Google, with other choices such as Facebook, Apple, or Phone Login available if enabled in **Adminx > Settings > Registration Settings**.

The **Welcome Message** displayed below the logo can be customized to reflect tenant branding or a tailored greeting, adjustable via **Adminx > Settings > App**. Social login options simplify the login process by automatically retrieving basic information (name, email, and profile image, if available) from the selected social account. If additional information is required, users will be prompted to complete the remaining registration fields.

For returning users with an email-based account, there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù button at the bottom right of the screen for easy access.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/3a477b7c-9d11-4130-acbf-db4e3ddb78ba/image.png)

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/bbe97a35-ef7d-4398-ae35-fb80028cad8b/image.png)

### Local Login

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/a81bb415-8a55-4461-aabf-2610a811eab4/image.png)

With the email-based login, users can create a tenant-specific account. Based on the settings in Adminx, they may need to complete specific profile fields and set a password. Once registered, they are immediately logged in.

### Social Login

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/f3ea135a-7084-4f4a-b3e7-4288e04bd7b3/image.png)

Social login options like Google, Facebook, or Apple allow users to log in with a single click. Only essential details (name and email) are retrieved, and no password is needed. If the tenant has additional registration requirements, users will be prompted to complete those fields.

### Forgot Password

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/6363906f-b493-4f08-935a-206cf59fddd6/image.png)

If users forget their password, they can initiate a reset by selecting the ‚ÄúForgot Password?‚Äù option on the login screen. They will be prompted to enter their registered email address, and if the email exists in the system, a reset link will be sent to that address. This link allows users to set a new password and regain access to their account.

This option is accessible through both the **Login** screen and the **Log in with Email** flow.

## üè†Home

The **Home** screen in Clientx is a dynamic, fully customizable interface designed to fit the unique needs of each event or venue. Clientx isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all solution‚Äîit's a versatile toolbox that empowers you to decide what features to display, how they look, and how users interact with them. Every element on the Home screen, from wallet balances to news feeds, can be configured and tailored in **Adminx** to suit specific event requirements and user expectations.

Whether you‚Äôre enabling a simple payment system, a multi-currency wallet, or real-time event updates, Clientx‚Äôs modular design allows you to activate, deactivate, or adjust features on the go. This flexibility lets organizers make real-time changes based on crowd dynamics, user preferences, or operational needs, providing a responsive and engaging experience for attendees.

With anyKrowd, you have complete control over the user journey, ensuring the platform adapts effortlessly to various scenarios and event configurations. The power is in your hands to create an interface that aligns with your brand and operational goals.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/81d49a96-b086-4caa-b05d-b63fa08ba1bd/06723f86-a1c6-4649-9f36-f25cb9402356.png)

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/7e0273e2-282e-4166-835c-d6dea91bff6a/aad29183-f5c5-4a24-900b-28c5f692cefe.png)

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/3c36fbef-d6e0-486c-9594-21ecc7b5c5ca/image.png)

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/23a89872-28f5-4bb3-a19b-877ec4bb44b1/image.png)

### Summary View

The starting view/page of Clientx displays the most important features for users. It shows the user‚Äôs identity with options to manage profile details, provides access to wallet balance across multiple currencies, and enables access to order history with the ability to request refunds. The most recent news and event updates are also visible. For RFID-driven events, features like ‚Äúpublic mode‚Äù and ‚Äúfull guest mode‚Äù are optimized for situations where accounts are not mandatory, making guest wallets the primary interaction method. Every feature is configurable within anyKrowd to suit specific event requirements.

### Wallet Connectivity Status

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/88d6db96-91bb-4948-9a54-9d09659c2b72/image.png)

When the user has an internet connection, the wallet balance updates automatically in real time. If the user is offline, the app displays a message indicating the loss of connectivity, and the wallet balance is no longer displayed as it is not being updated. However, users can still make payments offline, as the personal Payment QR code is cached in the phone‚Äôs memory (native app only).

### Payment QR Code

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/a32f9a66-c3fe-47a7-a7d5-6b3b8c5c767e/image.png)

The personal Payment QR code is used to make payments at all Staffx POS devices. Linked directly to the user‚Äôs wallet, it contains all necessary information and functions offline. The Payment QR code remains valid for a specified duration (configured in Adminx App Settings) and is cached in the phone‚Äôs memory (native app only). If the QR code expires, it cannot be used for payments until refreshed. When a user opens the Payment QR code, the phone automatically increases brightness for optimal scanning.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/a94d582b-2539-4a74-bc8b-0098b6a3e0a6/image.png)

### RFID (Use Cases)

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/c0569a0b-ee8c-4e84-acb5-51023836ee4c/image.png)

RFID in the anyKrowd platform offers a flexible, guest-first payment solution designed for a seamless event experience. With an RFID wristband or card, attendees can make cashless payments through a **guest wallet** linked to a QR code, which provides all the necessary functionality without requiring an app or account. This setup makes RFID ideal for first-time or casual users, enabling a smooth, accessible entry point.

For events that encourage deeper engagement, organizers can configure RFIDs to allow attendees to link or create a full account during key touchpoints, such as the refund process. This transition brings users into the Clientx app or web environment, unlocking all additional features such as transaction history, loyalty rewards, and the ability to top up or manage wallets online.

**Key RFID Applications** include:

- **Guest-First Experience**: Provides quick, easy access to cashless payments through a QR-linked guest wallet without requiring an app. Users can later create an account if desired, allowing them to retain wallet balances and access enhanced features or can experience in ‚Äúfull guest mode‚Äù an quick & easy guest flow & refund process.
- **Company Spending Cards**: Pre-paid or postpaid RFID cards can be distributed to employees, clients, or guests, with all transactions tracked under one company account. System Tags can be used to segment users for personalized engagement.
- **Birthday Packages & Gift Vouchers**: RFID-enabled vouchers can carry pre-loaded balances for special events, along with associated tickets or perks, and can automatically segment users for personalized engagement.
- **Table Reservations**: RFID cards can represent a shared budget for reserved tables, available as pre-paid, postpaid, or split (e.g., 50% up front, 50% on arrival). These can be single cards tied to an account or a set of cards linked to a shared wallet.

Additionally, anyKrowd‚Äôs RFID system allows multiple cards to be linked to a single Wallet. This feature is ideal for groups or companies, enabling one Wallet to support multiple users, such as friends, family members, or colleagues, creating a cohesive group experience with centralized spending control.

### Linked RFID (Wristband / Card)

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/e37d19fd-c64e-417d-a375-a9fcbd3ed200/image.png)

Users can link multiple RFIDs to their account/wallet. When an RFID is linked, it acts as an extension of the wallet/Payment QR code, allowing payments at Staffx POS devices. Users can view, delete, or link new RFIDs as needed. Linking RFIDs is optional but may be required for certain event configurations, such as ‚ÄúRFID-first‚Äù events. In such cases, attendees can use a wristband or card with a QR code that opens a wallet view when scanned, enabling top-ups via a web interface, tracking transaction history (wallet history button), requesting refunds, and accessing essential event information.

### Linking an RFID

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/04e9ca44-7fe9-4224-9364-b3013c1c4643/image.png)

When users click the ‚ÄúRFID‚Äù icon, an overview of all linked RFIDs is displayed.

To link a new RFID, users click the ‚Äú+‚Äù button, which prompts them to allow camera access and opens the phone‚Äôs camera. The user scans the QR code on the RFID wristband or card and confirms it by scanning again. Once confirmed, the RFID is successfully linked to the account, and any remaining balance on the RFID is transferred to the user‚Äôs wallet.

### News Wall

The News Wall appears on the **Home** screen of the Clientx (web) app, showcasing all published content and events relevant to the user. Posts can be visible to all users or targeted to specific segments based on set criteria.

- **Interaction**: Users can click on any post or event to open a detailed view with more information. Each post includes a ‚ÄúView Details‚Äù button for easy access.
- **Push Notifications**: When new content is published, push notifications can be sent to notify users of updates. (optional)
- **Customization**: Posts can be fully customized using HTML/CSS to align with the event or venue branding. For more detailed configuration, refer to **Adminx > Manage > Content**.

Posts appear on the Home page as **content posts** on the News Wall and can be opened via the ‚ÄúView Details‚Äù button.

## üë§ Profile / Account

The core of Clientx is a user‚Äôs profile or account, which serves as a foundation for meaningful engagement. By encouraging account creation and onboarding as many users as possible, you unlock powerful community-building tools. We recommend converting as many people as possible into clientx accounts, whether through ticket sales, data imports, or social media integrations.

**Conversion Channels:**

- **Ticket Sales** (including historical sales data)
- **Imports** from existing email databases
- **Social Media Integrations**, converting followers from platforms like Facebook or Instagram

The ultimate goal is to grow a strong community around your platform, identifying and understanding your visitors. This community-building approach is a core component of anyKrowd‚Äôs platform, providing valuable insights and connection opportunities for organizers.

**Guest to Profile Conversion**:
Visitors using a guest RFID (wristband or card) can later create a profile as part of the refund process. During this process, they are prompted to create an account, enabling them to receive refunds and access other personalized features.

### üü¶Legal & Terms and Conditions

Users can review the **Terms & Conditions** and **Privacy Policy** directly within the app. These documents can be configured and customized for each tenant via **Adminx > Settings > App**. anyKrowd provides a template for both, which the Project Manager (PM) can fill in and adjust to meet specific needs, ensuring that customers are informed of their rights and obligations.

This step is mandatory for acceptance on Google and Apple app stores for native apps and is a legal requirement for organizers to provide to end users.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/2426f826-1c33-40c3-9f12-a0882baee3fe/image.png)

### üü¶Install App

When using the web app, users may see a pop-up prompting them to install the native app if it is available. Additionally, an ‚ÄúInstall App‚Äù button is displayed, which directs users to the correct native app download via a deeplink for Apple or Google. This deeplink needs to be configured in **Adminx > Settings > App** for this mechanism to function correctly.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/81831b9f-4eeb-4c82-8bca-e34c7b64572c/image.png)

### üü¶Change Password

The ‚ÄúChange Password‚Äù option allows users to update their current password. Selecting this button will prompt the user to enter a new password, enhancing account security. This feature is useful if users suspect unauthorized access or simply wish to update their login credentials.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/c60347ce-1b3d-4c2b-a91d-2d7e1916b590/315dfdfe-1b54-472f-9ccb-ba4d57d272e5.png)

### üü¶Logout

The ‚ÄúLogout‚Äù button enables users to securely sign out of their account on the app. This is recommended after each session on shared devices to prevent unauthorized access to the account.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/fa9b8e09-3c92-44e0-99bc-fdd5f6e0c8a7/image.png)

### üü¶Delete Account

The ‚ÄúDelete Account‚Äù option allows users to permanently remove their account from the platform. Upon selecting this option, users will be prompted to confirm their decision, as this action is irreversible. Once confirmed, all account data and associated information will be permanently deleted.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/fa88d963-e76a-4aba-9eb6-bdc9e0e9b0ad/image.png)

### üü¶Version Number

At the bottom of the Profile Details screen, the app version number (e.g., Version 2.0.6) is displayed. This is particularly useful for troubleshooting or reporting issues. Users experiencing technical problems are encouraged to take a screenshot or note the version number when contacting support. While the web app is always updated to the latest version upon refresh, knowing the version is essential for native app users, especially if updates are pending.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/1ec54b0e-e71c-4fad-9849-ac40b6ccea62/bc3de2b1-09a3-4257-b71f-0a7e5610a824.png)

### üü¶Invoicing

If the tenant is configured to allow ‚ÄòInvoicing‚Äô in Adminx App Settings, users can enter or edit their company details and activate invoicing, auto-invoicing, and auto-receipts. This setup triggers an invoice/receipt to be generated for each purchase, including the user's company information.

### üü¶Interest / Tag Management

If the tenant is configured with Public Tags, these appear to users as ‚ÄòInterests‚Äô. Users can select or deselect interests that are relevant to them. This allows for more detailed profiling based on these interests (public tags), which can then be utilized in the segments feature for targeted engagement.

System Tags, on the other hand, are invisible to users. These tags enable background tagging and segmentation without the user‚Äôs awareness, supporting refined user segmentation and personalization.

## ü™ôWallet

The Wallet feature provides a flexible, closed-loop payment solution that can be configured as either an app-based digital wallet or an RFID-based system. This setup incentivizes attendees to use the Wallet as their primary payment method, which not only speeds up transactions but also provides valuable data insights. By using the Wallet, organizers can enhance user engagement, reward loyalty, and create a seamless cashless experience‚Äîall while retaining control over every aspect of the payment ecosystem.

### üüßHome Overview

On the Home screen, users can view their wallet, which displays the available balance and provides options for selecting multiple currencies if configured in Adminx. A currency will only be visible to users if there is a balance in that currency or if it is set to be ‚Äúcreated automatically‚Äù for each user. Users can also choose to ‚Äúadd‚Äù money to their wallet if the currency is configured as ‚Äútop-uppable.‚Äù

### üüßAdd / Top Up

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/d4bbca59-f1bd-4f52-a1df-8e252a3f5302/image.png)

The ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button on the home screen allows users to add money to their wallet, opening the top-up screen. Users can add funds through ‚ÄúPackages‚Äù or a ‚ÄúFree Amount,‚Äù as configured in Adminx App Settings. If set up, a top-up message can provide extra information. Users can select a payment country from the top right, which adjusts available payment methods based on location. Once a user selects a package or inputs a free amount to top up and confirms by clicking the ‚ÄòContinue‚Äô button, they are directed to the payment screen (external partner: Viva Wallet or Mollie). After completing the payment, users receive a confirmation screen (with an optional confirmation message if configured) and the funds are added to their wallet. A receipt is generated (visible in the Transactions overview), and a confirmation email is sent. For RFID-first or RFID-only events, top-ups are primarily done by scanning the QR code on the RFID wristband/card, which then opens the wallet top-up view via the web interface.

### üüßRedeem Voucher

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/44d5fdd1-89d0-4c8d-a07f-8c9338ccc021/image.png)

Users can redeem vouchers directly within Clientx.

By clicking the ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button in the wallet on the Home screen, users access the top-up screen. At the bottom of this screen, a ‚ÄúRedeem Voucher‚Äù text button appears.

The **Redeem Voucher** screen allows users to easily add value or access specific perks by redeeming a voucher code. Users can enter the code manually or use their device's camera to scan a QR code, making the process both quick and user-friendly.

- **Input Voucher Code**: Users can type the code directly into the provided field. This is useful when a physical or printed voucher is provided without a QR code.
- **Use Camera**: The "Use camera" button allows users to scan a QR code for instant redemption. When selected, the app will prompt for camera permissions if not already granted, then open the camera for scanning.
- **Continue Button**: Once the code is entered or the QR is scanned, users tap **Continue** to proceed. If the voucher is valid, the app will apply the associated balance, ticket, or item to the user‚Äôs profile.

**Note**: Vouchers can include various benefits, such as wallet credit, specific event tickets, or discounts. This feature can be customized in Adminx to support different voucher types, providing flexibility for organizers to design unique promotional strategies.

### üüßSwitch Currencies

If your wallet contains multiple currencies (top-uppable), you can click the small arrow on the top right next to the currency name to select a different currency, or swipe left and right through the different wallets to navigate between them.

This button on the Home screen allows users to manage their wallet settings.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/6e5f5db7-bbb1-4d32-8631-209bc8abf2b2/image.png)

The **Wallet** feature within Clientx serves as a powerful tool to attract, engage, and retain users while offering them seamless and transparent spending options. A digital wallet simplifies the event experience, allowing attendees to top up, manage funds, and make cashless transactions, creating a streamlined, frictionless flow that enhances both convenience and engagement.

### üüßKey Benefits of a Digital Wallet

- **Effortless Top-Ups and Management**: Users can easily add funds to their Wallet pre-event, during the event, or even post-event via the refund process. With multiple currencies and top-up packages configured by organizers, attendees have flexibility and control over their event spending, making it easy for them to stay engaged and ready to participate.
- **Real-Time Transaction Tracking**: The Wallet provides instant access to transaction history, allowing users to view, track, and manage all their event-related purchases in one place. Each transaction offers detailed insights, and by tapping into individual entries, attendees can access receipts with VAT breakdowns‚Äîperfect for expense tracking or accounting. This transparency reduces the need for manual invoicing, saving time and minimizing overhead for both users and organizers.
- **Enhanced Transparency and Trust**: By providing a clear, accessible record of all spending, the Wallet builds trust with attendees. VAT receipts are readily available, ensuring that users don‚Äôt need to request additional documentation. This transparency supports a positive experience and reinforces your event‚Äôs commitment to a seamless, user-friendly ecosystem.
- **Data-Driven Engagement**: A digital wallet is more than just a payment tool; it‚Äôs a strategic gateway to user engagement. Since the Wallet fulfills a core attendee need (spending ability), it naturally encourages users to sign up and participate. Once attendees activate or use the Wallet, they become part of your community, opening up opportunities for further engagement, loyalty programs, and targeted communications. You can leverage this connection to deepen loyalty and incentivize repeat attendance.
- **Flexible Timing for User Conversion**: The Wallet offers multiple touchpoints for user conversion, allowing you to bring users into your ecosystem at any stage. Users might initially join pre-event to top up funds, during the event to make cashless payments, or even post-event to request a refund. Each of these entry points provides a seamless pathway to registration, encouraging users to create an account and continue engaging with your brand.

The Wallet transforms event payments into a rich opportunity for engagement, combining ease of use with powerful transparency and insights. By converting payments into a digital, data-driven experience, you turn a simple transaction into an ongoing relationship with your community.

### üüßTransactions

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/b6cd2ac5-be23-490a-9f8c-bc2d88667655/image.png)

Clicking the ‚ÄòHistory‚Äô button opens a page displaying all transactions for the user. Clicking on a specific transaction reveals its details. The tenant‚Äôs VAT information (configured in Accountancy Settings in Adminx) appears on each receipt. Note that VAT is not applied to top-ups, as VAT is only added when the funds are spent on actual products. Receipts for spending show VAT details and breakdowns, which can be downloaded or screenshotted for accounting purposes, similar to a restaurant receipt. If the user has enabled ‚ÄòInvoicing‚Äô and entered Company Details, this information will also be included on all receipts.

### üüßRefunds

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/59afe588-5bac-442c-acf6-dbf755505acb/image.png)

Clicking this button allows users to manage their refund requests.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/df336d9b-5a80-4b94-8df3-8552f8796779/image.png)

The **Refunds** screen allows users to request refunds for any unused balance in their Wallet through a simple, self-service option. This screen is designed to be flexible, with multiple settings customizable in **Adminx > Settings > App** to align with the organizer's policies and preferences.

- **Refund Banner**: At the top, a configurable Refund Banner displays any applicable processing fees for handling requests (e.g., ‚Ç¨0.50). Organizers can edit this message in Adminx to keep users informed about refund charges.
- **Request Refund Button**: The central **Request refund** button is the main action users select to initiate a refund. The system then checks the user‚Äôs eligibility for a refund based on criteria set in Adminx, such as refundable currencies, age of top-ups, package-specific rules, and online vs. manual top-up eligibility.
- **Refund Processing Time Notice**: Below the request button, a message indicates the expected processing time for refunds (e.g., up to 14 days). This period is determined by the **Refund Processing Days** setting in Adminx, allowing the organizer to define the timeline based on their operational needs.
- **Refund Requests Overview**: At the bottom, users can track the status of their refund requests in real time. Each entry shows:
    - **Status Indicator**: Color-coded status updates (e.g., pending, approved, refunded, declined, or canceled).
    - **Amount**: The requested or refunded amount in the local currency.
    - **Timestamp**: The date and time of the refund request for easy tracking.

All refund settings and processing controls are managed by the Refund Manager in Adminx, ensuring an efficient, transparent, and user-friendly refund experience that minimizes manual intervention and enhances attendee satisfaction.

Clicking the **‚ÄúRequest Refund Button‚Äù** will open the ‚ÄúRequest Refund‚Äù page

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/b0e84d5e-9f6b-4346-ad6a-3e1956b5d748/image.png)

### üüßRequest Refund

The **Request Refund** screen enables users to initiate a refund for eligible balances in their Wallet, with transparent details about what is refundable and what is not. The screen is structured to guide users through the refund process, while providing event organizers control over refund configurations in **Adminx**.

- **Refund Amount Field**: Users enter the desired refund amount here, up to the maximum eligible balance. This field dynamically reflects what can be refunded based on the eligibility settings defined in Adminx.
- **Refund Description**: Positioned below the title, this brief description offers users guidance on the refund request process.
- **Info Panel**: This panel breaks down the Wallet balance to clarify refundable and non-refundable amounts:
    - **Current Balance**: The total balance in the user‚Äôs Wallet, including both refundable and non-refundable funds.
    - **Not Refundable**: Shows the non-refundable portion, broken down by categories such as:
        - **Vouchers**: Non-refundable by default unless the entire currency is set to be refundable in full in **Adminx > Settings > Currencies**.
        - **Discounted Top-Ups**: Promotional or discounted top-ups that may be marked as non-refundable based on Adminx settings.
        - **Warranty Product Returns**: Any credits provided for warranty products (like eco cups).
    - **Amount Refunded**: Amount to be requested as refund
    - **Refund Fee (Incl VAT)**: The handling fee for refund requests, configurable by organizers in **Adminx > Settings > App.**
- **Refund Received**: This summary, at the bottom, calculates the net amount the user will receive after the refund fee deduction, providing full transparency.
- **Continue Button**: Tapping **Continue** submits the refund request according to the configured eligibility rules in Adminx.

### üüßAdminx Configurability

Event organizers have comprehensive control over refund eligibility and criteria, customizable in **Adminx** to suit the financial policies and objectives of the event:

- **Currency Refundability**: Set in **Adminx > Settings > Currencies**, organizers can designate each currency as fully refundable, partially refundable, or non-refundable.
- **Packages and Staffx Top-Ups**: Eligibility for specific package refunds and Staffx-based top-ups can be configured in **Adminx > Settings > App**.
- **Vouchers and Promotions**: By default, vouchers are non-refundable; however, setting full currency refundability in Adminx can extend refund eligibility to associated vouchers.

This **Request Refund** screen empowers users by clearly detailing their refund options, while Adminx settings offer organizers flexibility to tailor refund rules, balancing transparency for users with operational efficiency for event management.

## üçπSelf Order

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/20030ae8-8366-41e0-9b01-f47732fcda4d/image.png)

If **Self-Order** is activated in AdminX and configured within the Sales Catalogue, a **Self-Order** button will appear on the home screen. This feature enables users to place orders directly from their devices.

- **Accessing Self-Order**:
    
    Depending on the AdminX configuration, users may need to:
    
    - Manually select their location from a list.
    - Scan a QR code assigned to a specific spot or table.
    
    This configuration (spot selection or QR validation) is managed in AdminX under Sales Catalogue settings. Once the location is validated, the correct menu or sales catalogue linked to that spot becomes available, allowing users to browse and order items.
    
- **Order Processing**:
    
    Once an order is placed, a ticket is printed at the designated location via the PrintX server. This ticket alerts staff to prepare the order for either **pickup** or **delivery** to the user.
    

> Note: Self-Order currently offers flexibility for orders with or without payment, depending on the event's configuration.

This functionality is partially available in V2 and is under active development for further improvements.

## üîóShare Wallet

The **Share Wallet** feature allows users to share their wallet balance with others, making it easy for friends or family to add funds or contribute to a shared event experience.

### How to Enable Share Wallet

1. **Activate in AdminX**:
    - Navigate to **AdminX > Settings > App**.
    - Toggle on **Activate share wallet top-up in ClientX**.
    - Once enabled, the **Share Wallet** button will appear on the ClientX home screen, allowing users to access the feature.
    
    ![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/0af55a0e-cd20-4910-8bd3-ef4a9ef48f31/image.png)
    

---

### How It Works

1. **Activate Sharing**:
    - From the home screen, users can tap the **Share Wallet** button. This opens the phone's native sharing options, allowing them to share a unique link via text, email, WhatsApp, or other supported platforms.
        
        ![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/1ae9bc1a-0701-4a2e-8d75-40bf90ef6c20/image.png)
        
2. **Guest View & Top-Up**:
    - When someone opens the shared link, they see a **Guest View** of the wallet, available in both web and native app formats. This view allows others to top up the wallet but does not grant payment permissions.
        
        ![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/5a527d91-a3b1-4aff-9c8e-b9d23acfed13/image.png)
        
3. **Payment Access**:
    - Only the primary wallet holder can make payments with the wallet via a **Payment QR code**. However, if the wallet is linked to an RFID, all connected RFIDs can be used to make payments at StaffX POS devices.
4. **Customizable Text**:
    - The text displayed under the wallet balance (e.g., currency or special instructions) can be configured in AdminX under **currency settings**. This customization allows for tailored messaging to fit the event's needs or audience.

---

### üéü Use Cases

- **Group Pots**: Friends attending an event together can create a shared "group pot" by topping up one user‚Äôs wallet via the shared link. This simplifies expenses and ensures everyone can contribute to the group‚Äôs spending fund without managing multiple wallets.
- **Parental Support**: For family events or festivals where children may have limited spending control, parents can monitor and top up a child‚Äôs wallet remotely, giving them access to funds while maintaining control over spending.
- **Event Sponsorships**: Sponsors or partners can use the shared wallet link to quickly add funds to a guest‚Äôs wallet, facilitating sponsored experiences or promotions.

---

### üí° Tips & Tricks

- **Security with RFID Linking**: When wallets are linked to RFIDs, attendees can make payments at StaffX POS devices with any of the linked RFIDs. This is ideal for families or friend groups who want shared payment access, but be mindful of security if sharing among large groups.
- **Effective Messaging**: Customize the text below the wallet balance in AdminX to guide users effectively. For example, "Top up to enjoy faster service!" or "Add funds to unlock exclusive offers!" This messaging can improve engagement and clarify how to use the feature.
- **Encourage Early Top-Ups**: Promote the use of Share Wallet before the event to encourage attendees to add funds in advance. This reduces onsite top-up congestion and creates a smoother event experience.
- **Limit Payment Access**: For users who only want others to add funds but not spend them, remind them that they control access to payment permissions. Only the primary user or RFID-linked users can make purchases.

## üéüÔ∏èTickets

If a user has tickets, a **Tickets** button will appear in the top right corner of the home screen above the wallet. This button displays the total number of tickets the user holds, and tapping on it directs them to the **Events** section under the **My Tickets** tab. Here, users can view all events for which they hold tickets.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/c4882bb1-97d8-4c3b-bbd8-1a8dfb5e60db/image.png)

### How It Works

1. **Ticket Access**:
    - When users tap the **Tickets** button, they are directed to the **My Tickets** tab, where each ticketed event is displayed in a list format.
        
        ![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/6f7cccf2-90be-472d-990b-ca5d87786240/image.png)
        
    - Users can see the event details, including the event name, date, location, and the number of tickets they hold for each event.
2. **Account Requirements**:
    - For tickets to be visible in **My Tickets**, users must be logged in with the same account associated with the email to which tickets were assigned.
    - If a user cannot find their tickets, they might be logged in with a different account, or the ticket may have been assigned to an alternate email (such as through a friend or due to a typo during purchase).

---

### üéü Use Cases

- **Event Access Verification**: Users can quickly verify their tickets for upcoming events and display them at entry for a seamless check-in experience. Having tickets readily accessible in the app reduces entry delays and ensures all necessary event information is easily available.
- **Community Onboarding and Engagement**:
    - **Integrated Benefits**: When users have their tickets integrated within the app, it serves as a seamless gateway into the event‚Äôs community. By encouraging attendees to view their tickets in the app, organizers can introduce them to features like exclusive offers, in-app top-ups, event maps, and real-time updates.
    - **Incentives to Use the App**: Offering special benefits to users who access their tickets via the app significantly drives engagement. For example, attendees with app-based tickets could enjoy benefits such as:
        - **Cheaper Drinks or Top-Up Discounts**: Exclusive in-app discounts incentivize attendees to start using the app early, encouraging them to top up and explore other features.
        - **Special Packages**: Access to unique in-app-only packages (like VIP lounges or early bird access) creates added value for app users.
        - **Fastlane Entry**: Fastlane access for app-based ticket holders promotes convenience and faster entry, enhancing the overall attendee experience.
        - **In-App Top-Up**: With in-app tickets, attendees can top up funds directly in the app or have a voucher attached to it, eliminating the need to stand in line at physical top-up stations. This convenience improves the user experience and reduces congestion at top-up points.
    - **Effective Communication**: Since attendees generally rely on their tickets for entry, providing digital tickets in the app ensures they engage with all ticket-related updates and reminders. This makes ticketing an effective tool to onboard users into the app, where they can access exclusive event content and benefits.
- **Segmented In-App Ticketing Options**:
    - **Public Ticketing Partner Links**: For broader audience reach, public ticketing links can be shared across social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, driving general ticket sales.
    - **In-App Exclusive Tickets**: By offering exclusive, segmented tickets within the app, organizers can provide unique options that aren‚Äôt available to the general public. These might include discounted rates, VIP packages, or member-only offers.
    - **Targeted Promotion**: In-app ticket segmentation allows organizers to tailor ticket offers based on attendee types, loyalty levels, or previous purchase behavior. For example, repeat attendees could receive special discounts or perks, while new users might get an introductory offer. This segmented approach not only increases ticket sales but also strengthens attendee loyalty and engagement.

---

### üí° Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Ensure Account Consistency**: Remind users to log in with the same email account they used during ticket purchase to avoid visibility issues in the **My Tickets** tab.
- **Double-Check Email Entries**: During ticket purchase, encourage users to verify their email address to prevent tickets from being assigned to an unintended email.
- **Alternate Accounts**: If users don‚Äôt see their tickets, suggest they check alternate accounts or emails they might have used during purchase or ask friends if they were supposed to receive the tickets.

- **View Details**: Tapping on an individual ticket entry provides further event details, helping users stay informed about event timings, location, and other critical information.

- **Edit Ticket**: If enabled in Adminx event settings, an ‚ÄúEdit Ticket‚Äù button will appear. Clicking on this allows the user to update the ticket holder‚Äôs name and email. The new recipient will then receive an email with the message ‚ÄúYour friend sent you a ticket.‚Äù This ticket can be downloaded from the email and will be visible in the recipient‚Äôs profile.

### Buy Tickets / Ticket Selection

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/82f25769-03ba-4ac2-adf8-e5a0ad41f821/image.png)

Clicking the **"Buy Tickets"** or **"Buy More"** button opens the **Buy Tickets** screen. This interface can also display **"Register"** if only free ticket type(s) are configured for the event. If an **External Link** is configured, this button will redirect users to the specified external ticketing site, as set in **Adminx > Manage > Events**. The ticket types shown here can include both anyKrowd ticket types (like in this example) and external tickets managed through integrated partners like SeeTickets or Eventix.

**Ticket Types** may include:

- **Members-Only Invitations**: Visible only to profiles tagged with a specific system tag (e.g., #member), as configured in **Adminx > Settings > Tags**. This invitation type can also be limited to a specific quantity per user.
- **Public Tickets**: Available to guests or any users, with or without a profile, depending on the access configuration.

In the HTML content post, a **"Buy Tickets"** button may still link to the public ticket shop of the integrated partner. Clicking this link directs users to the partner's site for purchase.

To close the **Buy Tickets** screen and return to the event detail page, users can click the **‚ÄúX‚Äù** icon at the top of the screen.

### Ticket Details / Checkout

Once tickets are added to the cart, users proceed to the **Ticket Details / Checkout** screen. Here, users can complete the required personalization details for each ticket, ensuring each ticket is linked to the correct attendee.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/528e9bff-4329-403f-8a63-914fc6387b18/image.png)

**Personalization and Checkout Process**

- **Ticket Holder Details**: Clicking **"Add Members"** or **"Continue"** directs users to the personalization section, where they fill out the details of each ticket holder. This personalization is currently a mandatory step, ensuring each ticket is accurately assigned.
- **Fast-Checkout (Upcoming Feature)**: A fast-checkout option, which would allow users to purchase multiple tickets by only entering the primary buyer‚Äôs details, is on the development backlog. This feature would streamline checkout for users accessing tickets via **guest mode** or **public mode**.

Finally, users can review the **Checkout** button at the bottom to complete the purchase once all required information is filled out.

### Checkout Options

The **Checkout** screens provide users with flexible options to complete their ticket purchase, depending on their Wallet balance and the type of ticket they‚Äôre acquiring.

---

Left Screen: Wallet Checkout

In the leftmost screen, users have sufficient funds in their Wallet to cover the ticket cost, allowing for a quick checkout. The **Pay Now** button confirms the purchase instantly using the available balance. If the ticket is free, a future update will replace "Pay Now" with **Register Now** for a smoother user experience. This adjustment is currently planned on the development backlog.

---

Middle Screen: Top-Up & Pay

The middle screen illustrates a scenario where the user's Wallet balance is insufficient to cover the ticket cost. In this case, the **Top-Up & Pay** button is displayed, redirecting the user to the payment gateway to add the necessary funds and complete the purchase in a single step.

---

Right Screen: Viva Payment Gateway

Upon selecting **Top-Up & Pay**, users are directed to the payment gateway, shown here with **Viva Wallet**. The payment screen provides various payment methods configured in **AdminX > Settings > App** and on the Viva platform. The options are also influenced by the user's device (e.g., Google Pay or Apple Pay availability) and regional payment preferences.

In this example, **Bancontact** (a popular Belgian payment method) is available. Users can choose to:

1. **Open the Bancontact app** directly from their bank on their device.
2. **Scan the QR code** with another device or app that supports Bancontact, facilitating payment through their preferred method.

Additional options may include Visa, Mastercard, and other region-specific methods, depending on configurations in AdminX and Viva. For more specific configurations or options, users should consult their anyKrowd Project Manager or their Viva Account Manager to ensure payment methods align with user and event needs.

## ‚ùåBookings

> Currently unavailable in Version 2. This feature is under development for future releases.
> 

---

### üéü Potential Use Cases

- **VIP Table Reservations**: Allow attendees to book VIP tables or reserved seating areas directly through the app. This provides a streamlined experience for VIP guests, allowing them to secure premium seating ahead of time and enhancing the exclusivity of their event experience.
- **Activity and Workshop Registration**: For events with scheduled activities or workshops, the Bookings feature could be used to manage attendee registrations. This ensures that popular activities don‚Äôt get overcrowded and allows organizers to maintain an optimal experience for all attendees.
- **On-Site Services**: Enable attendees to book on-site services such as personal lockers, phone charging stations, or even exclusive meet-and-greets with performers. This can enhance the attendee experience by providing added convenience and special access.
- **Transportation and Accommodation**: For larger, multi-day events, allow attendees to book transportation options or accommodation directly through the app. Partnering with local hotels or transportation services could offer attendees a one-stop solution for all their event-related bookings.
- **Waiting List Management**: For high-demand bookings, enable a waiting list option. If a reserved spot becomes available (due to cancellations or no-shows), the system can automatically notify users on the waiting list to RSVP, or allow organizers to select someone manually, based on the event's policy. This is especially useful for managing premium experiences or bookings within the hospitality industry, such as resort or hotel amenities.

---

### üí° Future Tips & Best Practices

- **Early Access and Upselling**: For VIPs or loyal customers, offer early access to bookings, allowing them to secure reservations before general availability. Additionally, use upselling tactics within the booking process, such as suggesting premium packages or add-ons (e.g., champagne service with VIP tables).
- **Automated Confirmation and Reminders**: Set up automated confirmations and reminders for all bookings. This reduces the risk of no-shows and provides attendees with timely reminders, improving their event experience and reducing operational challenges on-site.
- **Flexible Cancellations and Modifications**: Implement a clear cancellation and modification policy that attendees can manage directly through the app. Flexibility in booking changes can improve customer satisfaction and reduce the workload for event staff.
- **Capacity Management**: Use bookings to effectively manage capacity for different event areas. By limiting and tracking the number of bookings, organizers can ensure that spaces like VIP areas, workshops, or special experiences don‚Äôt become overcrowded.
- **Efficient Waitlist Utilization**: When a spot becomes available, the waitlist feature can automatically trigger notifications to users in the queue, offering them a limited time to confirm. Alternatively, organizers can manually select attendees based on predefined criteria, ensuring the waitlist is managed according to event policies. This is particularly valuable in high-demand settings, such as exclusive workshops, VIP lounges, or resort services.

## üéâEvents

The **Events** tab, accessible from the bottom navigation bar, provides users with a centralized view of all available events. Users can toggle between two tabs: **All Events** and **My Tickets**.

### Navigation Options

- **View Details**: Clicking **View Details** on any event displays the detailed event page, where users can see event-specific information, including timing, location, lineup, and additional content (e.g., artist profiles, schedule).
- **Buy Ticket**: If tickets are available for purchase, a **Buy Ticket** button will appear at the bottom of the event page. This button may link to:
    - An external ticketing provider (if integrated).
    - An in-app ticket purchasing option through AnyKrowd.
    
    > Note: If the user already owns tickets for the event, an additional Tickets button will appear, providing direct access to their ticket(s).
    > 

---

### üéü Use Cases

- **Exploring Event Details**: Users can browse through all upcoming events in **All Events**, providing a convenient way to explore event options, read descriptions, check the lineup, and review ticket options. This overview helps attendees plan ahead and builds excitement by providing a sneak peek into what each event offers.
- **Ticket Purchasing and Quick Access**: The in-app **Buy Ticket** button allows for seamless ticket purchasing within AnyKrowd, improving user convenience. Once tickets are bought, they‚Äôre directly accessible under **My Tickets**, simplifying check-in on event day.
- **In-App Ticket Exclusives**: By offering exclusive tickets or segmented ticket options in the app, organizers can promote special perks or discounted tickets that aren‚Äôt available through external ticketing partners. This could include early bird specials, VIP packages, or loyalty discounts only accessible to app users.

---

### üí° Tips & Tricks

- **Promote In-App Engagement**: Encourage users to check event details in the app by offering app-exclusive content, such as artist previews, schedules, or special in-app-only promotions. This drives more traffic to the app, providing users with a richer experience while familiarizing them with the platform.
- **Use ‚ÄúMy Tickets‚Äù for Fast Check-In**: Having tickets readily available under **My Tickets** in the app enables users to access their tickets quickly, facilitating faster check-ins and reducing queues. This is especially beneficial for high-attendance events where streamlined entry is essential.
- **Segmentation for In-App Tickets**: If using an external ticketing partner for broad sales, consider offering in-app ticketing for segmented audiences (e.g., VIP access, discounted group rates). This not only promotes app engagement but also allows targeted offers for loyal users or community members. Additionally, sharing public ticketing links on social media (like Facebook or Instagram) directs general sales traffic, while in-app segmentation drives community-focused sales.
- **Highlight Benefits for App-Based Tickets**: Reinforce the advantages of purchasing and viewing tickets in the app, such as potential discounts, fastlane access, exclusive event updates, or in-app-only experiences. Messaging around these benefits (e.g., ‚ÄúEnjoy faster check-in and exclusive offers by using the app!‚Äù) can increase app downloads and active usage.

## üõíShop

The **Shop** is the public (web) storefront for the tenant, configurable via AdminX under **Shop**. This section allows event organizers to display and sell products or merchandise directly to attendees. Categories are displayed for easy navigation, and users can click on any category to view available products within that selection.

### Key Features

- **Product Details**:
    - Clicking on a product displays detailed information about the item, including description, price, and any available options (e.g., sizes, colors).
    - Users can add products to their cart directly from this view, making it easy to build a personalized shopping list.
- **Shopping Cart**:
    - Accessible via the cart icon in the top right corner, the **Shopping Cart** provides an overview of all selected products. It includes a **Checkout** button at the bottom, allowing users to complete their purchase when ready.

> Note: This feature is currently not fully operational in Version 2 and is under development for future releases.
> 

## ‚ùåQuiz / Surveys

> Currently unavailable in Version 2. This feature is under development for future releases.
> 

---

### üéü Potential Use Cases

- **Attendee Feedback**: Use surveys to collect feedback on various aspects of the event, such as event satisfaction, venue facilities, and staff interactions. Gathering insights from attendees can help organizers improve future events and enhance overall attendee experience.
- **Engagement Through Quizzes**: Offer interactive quizzes to engage attendees, educate them on event details, or promote brand partnerships. For example, a quiz about the event‚Äôs history or trivia about performing artists can create fun engagement opportunities.
- **Post-Event Surveys**: After the event, post-event surveys can be sent to attendees for feedback on their experience. These surveys could include questions on event satisfaction, areas of improvement, and likelihood of attending future events.
- **Sponsor and Partner Insights**: Quizzes and surveys provide an excellent platform for sponsors and partners to gain insights into audience preferences. Sponsors can leverage surveys to understand their target demographics better, or quizzes can be used to promote sponsor-related trivia and increase brand awareness.

## üó∫Ô∏èMaps

The **Maps** section in the app offers an interactive, zoomable map experience that provides users with important venue details. Configurable via **Adminx > Maps**, this feature allows organizers to upload custom maps or use Google Maps, making it highly adaptable to various event setups.

Organizers can add **interactive, clickable markers** that provide specific information about selected locations, guiding users to points of interest, entrances, parking areas, and more. These markers enhance navigation within the venue and can be tailored to showcase important information relevant to each event.

For example, in this scenario with **Asgaard**, a youth home and event venue, the map highlights:

- **Main Entrance**: Denoted by a marker, it directs users to the main access point, including details on nearby artist-only parking and visitor guidance.
- **Public Parking**: Another marker designates the public parking area, with additional information on facilities such as charging points and motorhome parking.

Additionally, customized maps, such as venue-specific layouts or festival grounds, can be uploaded to replace or supplement Google Maps. These custom maps give a branded experience, providing an opportunity for event organizers to creatively represent their layout and improve attendee navigation.

This flexible mapping feature not only improves the user experience but also supports efficient venue management, allowing attendees to move through the event space more seamlessly.

### üéü Use Cases

- **Pre-Event Hype and Engagement**: The detailed artist profiles, complete with bios and embedded media, allow users to explore artists beforehand, creating excitement for the event. This feature is especially valuable for events with lesser-known acts, as it encourages attendees to discover new music or performances.
- **Supporting Multiple Stages**: For multi-stage events, the Timetables section allows attendees to quickly switch between stages and view what‚Äôs happening across the venue. This is particularly beneficial for festivals or conferences where multiple sessions occur simultaneously.
- **Building Connections Through Multimedia**: By providing previews through embedded SoundCloud or Spotify links, attendees can engage with artists in advance. This builds a deeper connection with performers and creates a more immersive experience, especially when the artist‚Äôs music or background resonates with the attendee.

---

### üí° Tips & Tricks

- **Encourage Early Engagement**: Promote the timetable in advance to encourage attendees to explore the lineup, favorite artists, and plan their schedule. For example, send push notifications prompting users to start exploring the schedule and building their itinerary.
- **Optimize Detailed View with Multimedia**: Add artist profiles that go beyond simple biographies. Include multimedia like music previews or video links to engage users and encourage them to add new artists to their favorites list.
- **Utilize the Favorites View**: Encourage attendees to use the **Favorites View** to simplify navigation on event day. By filtering the schedule to show only their favorited activities, users can focus on their chosen experiences without getting overwhelmed by the full lineup.
- **Highlight Special Performances**: Use color-coding or visual tags to highlight unique or limited-time performances (such as headliners or special guests) on the timetable. This draws attention to key acts and helps guide attendees towards must-see performances.
- **Event-Based Recommendations**: Depending on user behavior, consider displaying recommendations for similar artists or events. If a user favors electronic music, for instance, suggest other artists in that genre or related stages to enhance their experience.

- **Linking to Events**: Select an event under "Events" to make the content post appear on the event's detail page. This is useful for event-related posts, like artist announcements or special promotions tied to that specific event.
- **Targeting Specific Segments**: Use "Segments" to reach a defined audience segment (segments are managed in Settings/Segments). For example, create posts targeted to VIP attendees or loyal customers to offer exclusive content or discounts.
- **Push Notifications**: Enabling "Send Notification on Save" triggers a notification each time you save the post. Notifications require a **Title** and **Summary Text** for clarity.
    
    > Tip: Use notifications selectively to prevent overwhelming users. Reserve them for high-value updates like last-minute ticket releases or exclusive offers.
    > 
    
    > Pro Insight: Consider the timing of your push notifications to optimize reach. Early in the day or just before peak engagement times (e.g., event evenings) may yield higher visibility.
    > 
- **Main Image**: Upload a main image to enhance the post's visual appeal on the ClientX Home feed. This image will help attract attention to the post.

### üì¢ Content Details

- **Summary Text**: This brief description (up to 255 characters) gives context on the feed and serves as the notification text.
- **Content**: Use the text editor to craft your message, which can include **text**, **images/videos**, and **HTML**. While HTML customization is available for branding purposes, avoid using complex CSS that could alter the layout unexpectedly. (JavaScript is not supported).
    
    > Tip: Experiment with multimedia elements like music embeds (from SoundCloud or Spotify) to create a richer experience, especially for artist or performance announcements.
    > 
    
    > Pro Tip: Encourage engagement by linking your posts with specific calls-to-action (CTAs), such as "Book Now," "Listen on Spotify," or "See Full Line-Up." Make these CTAs clear and easy to follow, leveraging HTML links if needed.
    > 
    
    > Shortcut Tip: Use CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+V to paste content from external sources without carrying over unwanted formatting. This is helpful when copying text from sources like Facebook, ensuring clean and consistent styling.

### üõ† Tips for Getting the Best Results with ü§ñKontentBoy

1. **Provide the Organizer‚Äôs Website or Flyer**
    - **Website URL**: Share the URL of the organizer‚Äôs or venue‚Äôs website. KontentBoy can ‚Äúscrape‚Äù the style, replicating the layout, colors, and overall aesthetic.
    - **Event Flyer**: Copy and paste event flyers or banners into the prompt, asking KontentBoy to take inspiration from them. This is ideal if the event has unique colors or a particular look and feel.
    
    **Example Prompt**:
    
    > "Use the style from [website link] and create an HTML section with a centered title, a brief event description, and a 'Buy Tickets' button in the same colors as the site."
    > 
2. **Replicate an Existing Layout**
    - If you like a specific design from an external site or previous project, you can paste that code or content into KontentBoy and ask it to replicate or tweak it. This is especially useful for consistent branding across different channels.
    
    **Example Prompt**:
    
    > "Here‚Äôs a section from our website [paste HTML/CSS here]. Can you recreate this and adapt it for our event‚Äôs content post with a call-to-action button?"
    > 
3. **Custom Fonts and Scripts**
    - **Limitations**: Custom fonts and scripts are not currently supported on the anyKrowd platform.
    - **Alternative**: Stick with web-safe fonts like Arial, Helvetica, and Times New Roman, or prompt KontentBoy to use standard font families close to the brand‚Äôs look. Specify your font choices if needed.
4. **Using Images in HTML/CSS**
    - To include images, host them externally on a service like Imgur or your own server. You can then insert these images as backgrounds, sponsor logos, or visual elements within your HTML content.
    
    **Example Prompt with Image Hosting**:
    
    > "Use this logo [insert image URL from Imgur] as the background image of a header section. Place the event title in the center with a semi-transparent overlay."
    >

### üèóÔ∏èEvent Settings

- **Status**:
    - Choose between **Draft** and **Published**.
    - Events in **Draft** are not visible on ClientX; only **Published** events appear to users. This setting is similar to content posts, allowing you to work on events privately until they're ready for release.
- **Refundable**:
    - Checking this box allows users to cancel and refund their ticket directly via ClientX (a refund fee may apply). This option provides flexibility for users who may not be able to attend.
- **Name**:
    - Enter the event‚Äôs name, which will be displayed prominently as the title on the feed (Home) and in the Events section. Use a name that clearly represents the event to make it easily identifiable for attendees.
- **Address**:
    - Set the location or venue for the event. You can either manually create a new address or use the **search/autocomplete** feature powered by Google Maps for known locations.
    - Important: Selecting an address ensures that it appears correctly in the greyed-out location fields, helping attendees easily locate the venue.
- **Target to Segments**:
    - This option allows you to limit the visibility of the event to specific user segments. Choose the desired segment(s) and click **Add** to target this event for only those users.
    - Useful for events aimed at particular groups, such as VIP guests or segmented audiences based on demographics.
- **Send Notification on Save**:
    - Enabling this toggle will send a **push notification** each time you click **Save** while the toggle is on. Use this to alert users of event updates or new events.
    - Note: Be mindful of the frequency of notifications, as each save will trigger one if enabled.

---

### üìÖDate & Time

- **Start Datetime** and **End Datetime**:
    - Set the event‚Äôs start and end times. If the event ends exactly at midnight (00:00), select the following calendar day as the end date.
    - These times will appear on the feed, in the Events chapter, and on user tickets.

    - Use this setting to control when QR codes on tickets become visible. By setting a **Delayed Delivery** date, you can keep the QR code hidden until a specific date, ideal for controlled access or timed releases.

---

### üëÅÔ∏èVisibility & Interactivity

- **ClientX Can See What Friends Are Going to an Event**:
    - This toggle, when enabled, shows users which of their friends are attending the event. Note: This feature may be partially operational until the full **Friends** functionality is implemented in V2.
- **Allow Users to Edit Ticket Recipient**:
    - Activating this feature allows users to transfer tickets to others by changing the ticket‚Äôs recipient details (name and email).
    - The new recipient receives an email notification stating, ‚ÄúYour friend has sent you a ticket,‚Äù with a button to access the ticket in the app. This is great for peer-to-peer transfers and enhances user convenience.

---

### üñºÔ∏èVisual Settings

- **Main Image**:
    - Every event requires a main image (suggested dimensions: **1200x628px** or **1920x1005px**). This image serves as the event‚Äôs visual on the feed (Home) and in the Events chapter, so use high-quality images to capture user attention.

---

### üÉèRFID & Custom Layouts

- **Card Creation Costs**:
    - Set a charge for creating a guest wallet with RFID, which is applied to the first top-up. StaffX allows for exceptions. This option is primarily useful for managing RFID cost recovery.

### üé´Ticket Types: Detailed Guide

The **Ticket Types** section is crucial for setting up ticket options for an event. This feature allows organizers to create tickets that users can either purchase or register for, providing flexibility in ticketing types, limits, and additional configurations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### Overview

- **Ticket Types** are essential for defining the types of access or bookable options available for an event. These can be free or priced tickets.
- If **no external Tickets link** is provided, created ticket types will be visible in ClientX, and users can interact with them directly on the platform.
- **No Ticket Types created?** No purchase or registration button will appear on the event detail page. For example:
    - If a free ticket (e.g., ‚ÄúRegistration‚Äù) is created, a **Register** button appears on ClientX.
    - For a priced ticket (e.g., ‚ÄúRegular Ticket‚Äù at ‚Ç¨15), a **Buy Tickets** button will show.

### External Tickets Link

- If the event uses an **external ticket shop** (e.g., on your website or a third-party service), enter the link under **Tickets Link (External)**. A **Buy Tickets** button will appear on ClientX, redirecting users to this link.

---

### ‚ûïCreating a Ticket Type

To add a new ticket type, click on **+ Add**. This opens the **Edit Ticket Type** window where you can configure specific settings for each ticket.

### üß∞Ticket Type Settings

- **Offline Ticket**:
    - Toggle **Offline Ticket** if you want to generate a limited number of tickets and download them as a PDF. These tickets are managed offline, and you won‚Äôt be able to generate more than the specified amount.
    - Leave this off for other types of tickets, as offline functionality is currently limited and may be expanded in future updates.
- **Name**:
    - This is the displayed name of the ticket type, visible to users on ClientX and in downloaded tickets (PDF format). Choose a descriptive name that fits the event‚Äôs branding.
- **Color**:
    - Choose a background color for the ticket type, providing visual distinction on ClientX.
- **Price**:
    - Set the ticket price here. This field is ignored for imported/integrated tickets managed by external systems, as their pricing is controlled outside of anyKrowd.
- **Currency**:
    - Specify the currency associated with the ticket price. This currency will be displayed in ClientX for the user‚Äôs purchase experience.
- **VAT Percentage**:
    - Enter the applicable VAT (tax) percentage for this ticket type, which will be reflected in the final price calculation.
- **Max Cap**:
    - This limits the total number of tickets that can be sold for this type.
    - Enter `1` for unlimited sales or `0` to mark it as ‚Äúsold out.‚Äù
- **Limit Tickets per User**:
    - Enable this to restrict the number of tickets a user can hold for this specific type. For example, set to 10 for ‚ÄúBirthday Guestlist‚Äù to allow a maximum of 10 tickets per user.
- **Description**:
    - Add a brief description for the ticket type. This will be displayed on ClientX during the ticket selection process but does not appear elsewhere.
- **Custom Datetime**:
    - If this ticket type has a unique start/end time (e.g., a dinner that starts 2 hours before the main event), use **Custom Datetime** to display a specific time on the ticket.

---

### üöº Sales Channels

- **Door Sales**:
    - When enabled, this ticket type is hidden from ClientX and only available for purchase at the event entrance via StaffX.
    - A **Sell Tickets at the Door** button appears in StaffX, and purchased tickets are checked in immediately.
- **Remote Sales**:
    - Enabling this makes the ticket type available only for remote sales, not public purchase on ClientX. Tickets sold remotely appear in the user‚Äôs ClientX account and can be used for check-in later.
    - Example: Promoters selling tickets in different locations might use **Remote Sales** so that tickets are held in the app, accessible for later check-in.

### Key Differences

- **Door Sales**: Ticket is checked in immediately upon purchase.
- **Remote Sales**: Ticket is generated in ClientX for later check-in at a different location or time.

---

### üëÄVisibility Options

- **Hide QR on Ticket**:
    - This hides the QR code in ClientX and PDF versions, turning the ticket into a proof of ownership rather than a scannable code.
    - Unhide at any time if needed, but note that downloaded/printed versions won‚Äôt automatically update with the QR.
- **Limit to Segments**:
    - Segment your ticket type to control its visibility for specific groups. Here are some use cases:
        - **#hide Tag**: Create a hidden ticket type by assigning the system tag `#hide`. Only users you manually add to this segment will see the ticket.
        - **Birthday Filter**: Restrict visibility to users with a specific attribute, such as ‚ÄúBirthday Month August,‚Äù making this ticket available only to those celebrating in August.
    - Important: After choosing segments, click **Add** to confirm. Remember to **Save** the ticket type and **Save** the event to retain changes.

---

### üõÉAdditional Ticket Customization

- **Assign Tags**:
    - Use this to apply public or system tags to ticket holders. Currently, tags are only assigned to the buyer, not all attendees.
    - Example: Use tags to mark users with a specific role or interest, aiding in post-event analysis.
- **Assign Voucher Groups**:
    - Assign one or more voucher groups to this ticket type. For example:
        - **Entrance + ‚Ç¨10 Voucher**: Attendees receive a ‚Ç¨10 voucher, which can:
            - Be scanned and linked to an RFID at check-in
            - Be redeemed on ClientX later as spending credit
    - Click **Add** after selecting vouchers to confirm.

---

### Organizing Ticket Types

- **Order Ticket Types**:
    - Use the **Order Ticket Types** button to define the order in which tickets are displayed on ClientX.
    - Ordering helps with visibility and priority, especially for highlighting VIP or limited-edition tickets at the top of the list.

---

### Location & Event Details

- **Custom Locations**:
    - Use this if the event requires specific, event-only locations. This helps with event-specific reporting. Otherwise, leverage the main **Locations** feature in **AdminX > Settings** for broader use.
- **Description**:
    - **Summary**: Write a brief overview (max 255 characters) for display on the ClientX home feed.
    - **Content Editor**: Add detailed information about the event, visible on the event‚Äôs detail page in ClientX. This can include text, HTML/CSS, images, etc., offering flexibility to match your brand‚Äôs look.

---

### Upselling Products

- **Upselling Products**:
    - Highlight products from the webshop related to this event. When configured, a **Related Products** page will appear within the event in ClientX, promoting additional items that users may be interested in purchasing.
    - **Note**: This feature is currently under development in V2 as the webshop requires further integration.

## üö™Gates & Zones

These sections require further clarification from Julien. Generally, they are used for designating specific areas within an event venue to streamline check-in processes and monitor attendee movement.

---

## üéüÔ∏è Event Combos

The **Event Combos** section enables the creation of combined ticketing options. This feature is integrated within the anyKrowd ticketing system, allowing you to group multiple events or ticket types into a single combo for streamlined access and enhanced attendee convenience.

1. **Creating a New Combo**:
    - Click **+Create** to begin a new combo.
    - Enter a **Name** for the combo.
    - Add a **Description** (visible only in ClientX for reference).
    - Choose the related events to include and click **Add**.
2. **Publishing Status**:
    - **Draft**: Combo is not visible in ClientX.
    - **Published**: Combo is accessible to attendees in ClientX.
3. **Visual Customization**:
    - Upload a **Custom Ticket Layout** for a unique visual on tickets within the combo. This layout can be downloaded by the user from ClientX or sent via email as a PDF.
4. **Ordering Ticket Types**:
    - Use the **Order Ticket Types** button to define the sequence of ticket types in the combo. This order is reflected in the user‚Äôs ticket view in ClientX, providing a structured display.

> Tip: Combos are ideal for bundled event access or special packages, such as multi-day festival passes. Customize each combo‚Äôs appearance and structure to optimize user experience.
>

## üé´ Assign Tickets

The **Assign Tickets** functionality allows admins to distribute tickets directly to users. Here‚Äôs how to assign tickets step-by-step:

1. **Select the Event**: Choose the event for which you are assigning tickets.
2. **Notification Settings**:
    - (Un)check **Send Tickets Assigned Email**: Opt to notify users via email upon ticket assignment.
    - Customize the notification template through **AdminX > Settings > Notifications** if desired.
3. **Free Tickets Option**:
    - (Un)check **Free Tickets**: Marking tickets as free removes their price from reporting. Otherwise, tickets will reflect their standard value in reports.
4. **Assigning Process**:
    - Select a user and ticket type, specifying the ticket quantity.
    - Confirm your selection with the **Assign Tickets** button.

> Note: If assigning tickets to someone who is not a registered user, use the +Create User button in the top-right or go to AdminX > Manage > User to add them manually.
> 

> Tip: Use the Free Tickets setting for complimentary tickets to staff or VIPs. This keeps your sales reporting accurate by excluding unpaid tickets.
>

## üì• Import Tickets

The **Import Tickets** function streamlines bulk ticket uploads. Use this feature to upload a list of tickets for an event in a predefined format.

1. **Accessing the Import Interface**:

    - Review past imports with the ‚Äúeye‚Äù icon for detailed status.
2. **Using the Import Template**:
    - Download the template via **Download Template** to ensure your import file matches the required format.

3. **Preparing the Import List**:
    - Ensure your file contains the following: First Name, Last Name, Email, Ticket Type, and **Ticket Value** (QR code data). The **Ticket Value** links the QR code to specific ticket types for access verification.
4. **Finalizing the Import**:
    - Upload the completed list. Confirm the details, then process the import to create tickets within the system.
    - Optional: Check **Users Will Receive Ticket Email** if you want users to receive email notifications for the imported tickets.

> Important: Only select Send Ticket Email if necessary, especially if users have already received tickets through other means.
> 

> Tip: Use this for pre-registered users or when transferring tickets from other systems.
> 

---

### üóëÔ∏è Bin

The **Bin** is a repository for deleted events, providing an option to review and restore items if needed. This feature ensures that deleted events can be recovered if removed accidentally.

> Tip: Regularly clear the Bin to maintain a clean interface. Only restore events that are essential.

## üë§ User

### üìä Overview of Users

In the anyKrowd platform, a ‚Äúuser‚Äù is defined as anyone who has created an account on the client web or native app. Based on configurations in **Settings/Registration**, user details may be **optional or mandatory** fields alongside the obligatory ones like **First Name, Last Name, and Email Address** (Phone Number will be added in a later release). Users must also (read and) accept the **Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy** upon account creation.

**Note**: For **imported users**, this acceptance step is mandatory upon their first login. It‚Äôs not completed at the moment of import.

Each user can:

- Hold **multiple wallets** (each currency constitutes a separate wallet).
- Own various **ticket types** across multiple events.
- Access a **unique Personal QR Code** that is valid for a specific duration. QR validity can be configured in **AdminX/Settings/App**.

üí° **Tip**: If users accidentally create multiple accounts (for example, using different emails for ticket purchases, app downloads, or friend invitations), they may encounter issues with tickets or wallets. This often results in support inquiries. Use the **search bar** to locate a user, even if they have multiple accounts under similar names.

### üîç Filters

Use the **Filter** options to narrow down the user list based on specific attributes.

### üìÅ Export CSV

Click this button to generate a full export of the user base in **.csv format**.

### üìÅ Export XLSX

Click this button to generate a full export of the user base in **.xlsx format**.

### üè∑Ô∏è Mass Assign Tags

This feature allows you to assign tags to multiple users simultaneously. While it‚Äôs helpful, it has limited flexibility. For more detailed tagging, consider using the **Tags settings** or **Prospects** features found in **AdminX/Settings/Tags**.

### üëÅÔ∏è View

Clicking the **eye icon** next to a user in the overview will open the **user detail page**. Here, you can view detailed information about the user, including:

You can also view:

- The user‚Äôs **wallet balances** (in various currencies).
- **Latest transactions** (click ‚ÄúClick here for detailed data‚Äù for a deeper look).
- An overview of all **Event Tickets** associated with this user.

### üîÑ View QR

This option allows you to view and download the **Personal QR Code** of the user, including a timestamp that indicates its validity.

### üí∞ Wallets

Clicking the **wallet icon** next to a user opens the wallets view for this specific user, where you can see all wallets automatically created. Each wallet corresponds to a currency, has a unique ID, balance, and transaction history.

You can:

1. Use the **Exchange Balance** button to move funds between wallets.
2. Create a new wallet using the **+ Create** button.

For specific **top-ups, wallet expiry, or refunds**:

1. First, select the wallet by clicking **View**.
2. This opens the wallet detail page, where you can find action buttons for **+ TopUp, Expire**, or **Refund**.

### Top-Up

Select an **amount** and **payment method**. When performing a top-up as an admin, use ‚ÄúAdminX TopUp‚Äù as the payment method and add a **reference** or description. This reference is visible in AdminX, StaffX, and ClientX for easy tracking. If adding to cash or card totals for accounting purposes, use the **cash** or **card** payment methods.

### Expire

- **Online**: Select this for online refunds (still under development for future automatic processing).

All refunds processed here will appear in the **AdminX/Report/Refund Management system** as pending, where you can approve or deny each refund. This ensures all refunds are recorded and processed through the standard SEPA file export for your bank.

### üö´ Ban / Block Temporarily

2. Import new users by **downloading and filling in the template**. Ensure the format matches the template exactly to avoid errors.

üí° **Tip**: Use the slider ‚Äú**users will receive onboarding email**‚Äù if you want the imported users to receive an onboarding email. This can be configured in **AdminX/Settings/Notifications**.

### üìÇ Prospects

The **Prospects** feature is similar to user imports but offers additional tagging options. This feature is particularly useful for:

- **Segmenting users** based on ticket sales data, music genre preferences, ticket type, etc.
- **Applying membership statuses** or other system tags.

With Prospects, you can tag imported users upon import, allowing for easier segmentation and targeted communications.

## üí∞ Wallets

### üìä Overview of Wallets

This section provides an **overview of all wallets** for all users, including **guest wallets**. Each wallet corresponds to a currency and reflects the balance for each user account.

- **Payment Method**: Choose the method for this top-up. Use ‚Äú**AdminX TopUp**‚Äù when performing top-ups as an admin. Be sure to include a **reference/description** for easy tracking in reports. This reference will appear across AdminX, StaffX, and ClientX for consistency.

üí° **Tip**: Use ‚Äú**cash**‚Äù or ‚Äú**card**‚Äù payment methods if you want the amount to appear in your day totals for accounting purposes.

### ‚è≥ Expire

Clicking the **Expire** button opens a confirmation popup:

- **Confirmation**: Confirm the expiry of this wallet balance. This action is **irreversible** and will be logged in AdminX, StaffX, and ClientX under wallet details.

### üîÑ Refund

5. Upload the completed file to process the import.

üí° **Tip**: Ensure the template is filled accurately to avoid errors during import. This feature is ideal for handling mass top-ups efficiently.

## üìä Sales

The **Sales** chapter details the setup and management of **Sales Catalogues** within the anyKrowd **Staffx POS** system. Sales Catalogues are critical for defining the products available at various sales points, controlling pricing, and organizing items into manageable categories. This configuration is essential for bars, food stands, merchandise outlets, and self-order stations.

---

### üìÇ Sales Catalogues Overview

**Sales Catalogues** represent structured menus for each point of sale on **Staffx** devices. They dictate what products are available and allow customization for specific locations or device groups, such as bars, kiosks, or merchandise stands. Catalogues are also necessary if you‚Äôre using the **Printx** system, as each printer connects to a specific catalogue.

üí° **Tip**: To streamline operations, you may want to create separate catalogues for each unique sales environment, like ‚ÄúMain Bar‚Äù or ‚ÄúFood Stand,‚Äù and duplicate catalogues as needed for Printx configurations.

---

### üîç Overview of Catalogues

On the **Catalogue Overview** page, you‚Äôll find a list of all existing catalogues, along with the following action buttons:

- **üíô Set as Default**: Sets the catalogue as the primary default. This default setting can be especially useful when you have multiple catalogues but want one to be prioritized, such as for primary bar sales.
- **üìë Duplicate**: Creates a copy of an existing catalogue, including its configuration. **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: In V2, product-specific price variations within categories aren‚Äôt duplicated, so it‚Äôs essential to review all settings, especially price variations, after duplicating.
- **‚úèÔ∏è Edit**: Opens the **Edit Sales Catalogue** page, allowing for modifications to the catalogue‚Äôs configuration.

### üõ† Editing a Catalogue

The **Edit Sales Catalogue** page is where you configure the core settings that define how the catalogue behaves on Staffx and Clientx. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of each setting:

1. **üìù Catalogue Name**: This is the display name for the catalogue (e.g., "Main Bar" or "Snack Stand"), which helps staff easily identify it in reports and on Staffx devices.
2. **üí± Default Currency**: Defines the main currency for transactions within this catalogue. This currency is displayed on Clientx and Staffx during the sales process.
3. **üì± Device Groups**: Link device groups to this catalogue. **Device groups** represent specific printers or devices configured through **AdminX > Settings > Devices**. This feature allows orders from this catalogue to print on designated devices if you are using Printx.
4. **üö´ Disable Payments for Self Orders**: Toggle this setting to allow self-orders to be processed without immediate payment. This is especially useful for **self-order kiosks** where customers can place orders, then pay upon delivery.
5. **üîç Segmenting the Catalogue**: You can segment catalogues to restrict access for specific user groups. When segmentation is enabled, only users in the defined segment can access the catalogue. Attempting to sell to a non-segmented user on Staffx will trigger a warning, allowing staff to either proceed with or cancel the transaction. This feature is beneficial for VIP areas, exclusive product offers, or memberships.

### üìë Managing Categories in Catalogues

Each **Sales Catalogue** contains **Categories** that help organize products into logical groups, making it easier for staff to locate items on **Staffx**. Examples of categories might include ‚ÄúSoft Drinks,‚Äù ‚ÄúAlcoholic Beverages,‚Äù ‚ÄúFood,‚Äù etc.

- **‚ûï Create Category**: Adds a new category within the catalogue. For instance, you could add ‚ÄúSnacks‚Äù to separate food items from drinks.
- **‚ÜïÔ∏è Sort Categories**: This lets you arrange the order of categories as they appear on Staffx, prioritizing popular categories if needed.
- **‚úèÔ∏è Edit / üóë Delete Categories**: Modify or remove existing categories as needed. Before deleting a category, ensure it‚Äôs not critical for device or segment assignments.

---

### üìã Managing Products within Categories

After setting up a category, you can add specific products to it by clicking the **Products** button next to the category name. This opens a detailed view where you can add and organize products.

1. **‚ûï Add Product**: Here, you add products that have already been created in the **Products** section to the selected category. To set up a product for this button, follow these steps:
    - **Select Price Variations**: Each product can have different price variations based on currency or location. When adding a product to a category, you must select the relevant price variations for that specific catalogue. Price variations must be preconfigured in the **Products** section, as they define how a product is priced based on the selected catalogue or location.
    - **Product Customization**: Customize each product button by setting the name, selecting a background color, and choosing from the available price variations for the product within this catalogue. Each button represents a unique product instance on Staffx, so accurate configuration is crucial.
2. **‚ÜïÔ∏è Sort Products**: Allows you to reorder products within the category to prioritize certain items (e.g., place frequently ordered items like water or soda at the top).

Each product entry includes:

- **üìå Name**: This is the clickable button name for each product on **Staffx**.
- **üíµ Sales Price**: The price displayed to customers, which can vary depending on the selected price variations.
- **üìä VAT Percentage**: The tax rate applied to the product. Ensure this is set correctly for compliance and accurate reporting.
- **üé® Color**: Choose a background color for the product button. Using colors strategically can help staff quickly locate high-demand items.

üîß **Product Actions**: Use the **Edit** (‚úèÔ∏è) and **Delete** (üóë) buttons to modify or remove a product from the category.

---

### üéâ Discounts

The **Discount** functionality allows you to apply discounts across the catalogue. Here‚Äôs how to set up a discount:

- **üè∑ Discount Name**: Provide a name like "Happy Hour" or "Seasonal Discount" for easy reference.
- **üí≤ Discount Type**: Choose either **Percentage of Price** (e.g., 10% off) or **Fixed Amount** (e.g., ‚Ç¨2 off each item).
- **üî¢ Discount Amount**: Enter the specific discount value.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: Discounts in V2 are limited and may require further development for complex setups. For now, use basic discounts with caution and verify that they apply as expected.

---

### üóë Deleting a Catalogue

To delete a catalogue, click the **Delete** button next to the catalogue name. Note that each new catalogue includes a **warranty products** category by default, useful if your setup integrates with **ECO**. If you don‚Äôt use ECO, you can repurpose the category or disable the ‚Äúwarranty‚Äù setting before deleting it.

---

### üì• Importing Catalogues

The **Catalogue Imports** page provides a history of all previous imports. To import a new catalogue:

1. **üìÑ Download the Template**: Use the provided template to format the import file accurately.
2. **üì§ Upload the File**: Select the file and confirm by clicking **Upload**.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Catalogue imports should be reviewed by the Product Manager (PM) before execution to prevent configuration mismatches.

---

### ‚ú® Creating a New Catalogue

When creating a new sales catalogue, follow these detailed steps:

1. **üìù Name**: Enter a descriptive name, such as "Bar Menu" or "VIP Drinks". Clear names help prevent confusion in reports and on Staffx.
2. **üí± Default Currency**: Define the currency that transactions will use. This will appear on **Clientx** and **Staffx**.
3. **üì± Device Groups**: Select relevant device groups, especially if you‚Äôre using **Printx** for printing orders. Device groups are defined in **AdminX > Settings > Devices**.
4. **üö´ Disable Payments for Self Orders**: Enable this if you want users to place orders without paying upfront. It‚Äôs commonly used for **self-order kiosks** where customers pay upon delivery.
5. **üîç Segmenting the Catalogue**: Select user segments if you want the catalogue to be visible only to certain groups. This feature is ideal for restricted access areas (e.g., VIP-only products). If a non-segmented user tries to order, Staffx will display a warning, giving staff the option to cancel or proceed.

After configuring your new catalogue, **Save** to store all settings.

### üõí Products

The **Products** section is essential for managing all items that can be sold within **Clientx** and **Staffx**. Products can range from beverages and food items to merchandise or tickets. Additionally, if a product has a refundable component (like eco-cups or battery packs), it‚Äôs classified as a **Warranty Product** and managed separately under that chapter.

---

### üìã Overview of All Products

This page displays a list of all products, whether created manually or imported. You can use the **Search** bar to locate specific products by name or other identifiers.

---

- **üîÑ Update Stocks**: Takes you to the **Update Stock** page, allowing you to upload a new stock reality or download a re-order slip. The re-order slip can be used as a template for further stock adjustments. This is relevant for products with **Managed** or **Cross Stock** types.
- **üì• Import**: Opens the **Products Imports** page, displaying an overview of all processed imports. Use the **Import Products** button at the top right to upload a new product file. **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always use the provided template, and consult the PM before importing, as changes are irreversible.

---

### ‚ûï Creating a New Product

Clicking **Create** opens a blank product setup form with the following fields:

1. **Name**: The product name, a required field for identification.
2. **Description**: This field is intended for **Clientx Self-Order** and provides additional product details, but it‚Äôs not fully operational in V2. Future updates will enable this feature.
3. **Picture**: Upload an image to represent the product in **Clientx Self-Order** and **Staffx POS**. To maintain a polished catalog, use consistent image styles and dimensions for products within the same category.
4. **Save**: Once the initial details are filled out, click **Save** to create the product. This redirects you to the **Edit Product** page, where further configurations can be applied.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Editing Product Details

In the **Edit Product** page, you can specify pricing, stock management, and additional product features:

- **Add Price**: Allows you to create one or multiple price variations for the product.
    - **Price Variation Name**: This is required and is for internal use only, such as "Regular," "VIP," "Discounted," "Happy Hour," etc. Although it won‚Äôt be visible in Clientx, it helps differentiate variations internally.
    - **Currency**: Select the currency for this price variation.
    - **Amount**: Set the amount to be charged for this variation.
    - **Tax Percentage**: Specify the VAT or applicable tax rate for this price.
    - **Linked Warranty Product**: Use this field to link a **Warranty Product** (such as an eco-cup or refundable item) to the product variation. **Note**: You need to create the warranty product first before it can be linked here.
    - **Set as Default**: Mark this variation as the default price when the product is accessed.
- **Stocks**: Define stock levels and management options for the product.
    - **Stock Type**:
        - **Infinity**: This is the default setting with no stock limit.
        - **Managed**: Allows you to set specific stock levels, including **Current Stock**, **Minimum Stock**, and **Maximum Stock**.
        - **Cross Stock**: Useful for composite items like cocktails or mixed drinks. Cross stock lets you add multiple sub-products (modifiers) to this primary product.

### üóëÔ∏è Bin

The **Bin** provides a history of deleted products. Here, you can review and restore deleted products as necessary. This feature is especially useful if a product was deleted accidentally or if seasonal items need to be reactivated.

### üåç Warranty Products

Warranty Products allow you to implement a refundable item system within your event or sales structure. These products, such as reusable cups or other returnable items, have a warranty fee associated with them, which can be refunded upon item return.

### üìù Overview of Warranty Products

The **Warranty Products** overview provides a list of all configured warranty items. This section works similarly to regular products but includes a **warranty fee** that can be returned to the customer. Given the added configuration complexity of warranty items, consulting with the Project Manager (PM) is recommended before setup, especially if:

- **Multiple Currencies** are involved. Example: You may want eco products (like cups) to be purchasable in various currencies but only refundable in a dedicated "eco currency." This can help limit the usage of refunded amounts, making them specific to eco products.
- **Sales Configuration** requires segmentation for warranty products or integration with other POS systems.

> Tip: Warranty products are often used with items like cups at festivals, where a deposit ensures the item is returned to reduce waste.

After creating the warranty product, the **Edit Warranty Product** page allows you to add and manage price variations. Each warranty product can have different price options to reflect various conditions:

1. **Price Variations**: Click **Add Price** to set multiple price options for the warranty product, such as:
    - **Regular Price**: Default sale price (e.g., ‚Ç¨1.00 for an Eco Cup).
    - **VIP Price**: A reduced or exclusive price for VIP users.

## üÜï Create RFID Group

To create a new RFID Group:

1. Click the **+Create** button.
2. **Name**: Provide a unique name for the RFID Group.

## üé´ Tags

Tags are fundamental to anyKrowd‚Äôs platform, serving as building blocks for **user segmentation, targeted interactions, and customized user journeys**. By tagging users with specific identifiers, you can segment them into various categories, enabling personalized communication, access control, and exclusive offerings. This is particularly useful for events, where specific groups of attendees (e.g., VIP guests, staff, different music fans) may need tailored experiences.

anyKrowd distinguishes between two main types of tags:

1. **Public Tags**: Visible to users in Clientx, allowing them to select or identify interests themselves - When displayed it shows in Black
2. **System Tags**: Hidden from end-users and used exclusively within Adminx, facilitating backend segmentation and operational control. - When displayed it shows in Grey

Let‚Äôs dive into each type and how they can be effectively used:

---

### üë• Public Tags

Public Tags appear in Clientx as Interests, where users can view and select tags that align with their preferences or interests. These tags help users filter content and give admins the flexibility to create interest-based experiences. Public Tags also aid in **self-segmentation**, allowing users to opt into categories that resonate with them, enhancing engagement and relevance.

### Creating a New Public Tag

To create a Public Tag, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings > Tags** and ensure you are in the "Public Tags" section.
2. **Click on ‚Äú+Create‚Äù** in the top-right corner to access the tag creation form.
3. **Name**: Provide a descriptive name (e.g., #techno, #house, #urban, #top50). Names should be intuitive to users and align with interests or segments you want to define.
4. **Parent Tag** (optional): Choose an existing tag as a parent if you want to create a tag hierarchy.
5. **Expiration Days**: Define the duration (in days) the tag should remain active. For example, if the tag is part of a limited-time campaign, set it to expire at the end of the promotion.
    - *Upcoming Feature*: Future releases will allow setting expiration in hours or by specifying a fixed date and time, giving more precision for temporary or event-based tags.
6. **Type of Tag**: Ensure this is set to ‚ÄúPublic‚Äù so it‚Äôs visible to users within Clientx.
7. **For New Users**:
    - **Auto-assign to new users**: Toggle this to automatically assign the tag to every new user. This is ideal for universal tags like #NewUser or #WelcomeMember, where all new sign-ups receive the tag.
8. **For Existing Users**:
    - **Do Nothing**: Choose this if you don‚Äôt want to apply the tag to any current users.
    - **Add to Everyone**: Use this option to assign the tag to all existing users in bulk (may take a few minutes with large databases).
9. **Save the Tag**: Click **Save** in the top-right corner to finish. The tag will now be listed in Public Tags and will be selectable by users in Clientx.

### Practical Use Cases for Public Tags

Public Tags are especially useful for interest-based tagging, allowing users to personalize their experience based on what they enjoy. Here are some examples:

- **Music Interests**: Tags like #techno, #house, #urban, #top50 can allow users to select their preferred music styles, helping them navigate to relevant content and events within Clientx.
- **Access Levels**: Use tags such as #VIP or #GeneralAccess to let users identify their access level, giving them visibility into what‚Äôs accessible based on their status.
- **Event-Specific Interests**: For multi-genre festivals, users can select tags based on the stages or zones they prefer, like #MainStage or #ElectronicZone, making their experience more tailored to their tastes.

**Tip**: Encourage users to update their Public Tags based on their evolving preferences. This keeps their experience personalized and relevant.

### Editing or Deleting a Public Tag

- **Edit**: Click the **Edit** icon next to a tag to adjust its details, such as changing the name, updating the expiration, or modifying assignment settings.
- **Delete**: Click the **Delete** icon to permanently remove the tag from the platform. This action removes the tag from all users.

---

### üîí System Tags

System Tags are internal and do not appear to users within Clientx. Instead, they allow admins to create complex segmentation behind the scenes. These tags can be used for backend operations, such as differentiating user types, setting access controls, or enabling targeted notifications to specific groups.

System Tags offer **enhanced flexibility and control** over how users are grouped and managed. Here‚Äôs how to use them effectively:

### Creating a New System Tag

To create a System Tag, follow these steps:

1. In the **Tags** section, switch to ‚ÄúSystem Tags‚Äù by selecting it from the menu.
2. **Click on ‚Äú+Create‚Äù** in the top-right corner to access the System Tag creation interface.
3. **Name**: Enter a name for backend use (e.g., #InternalStaff, #Member, #BigSpender, #NoSpending). The name should clearly indicate its purpose.
4. **Expiration Days**: Define the number of days the tag should remain active.
    - *Upcoming Feature*: Future versions will allow for expiration in hours or by specifying an exact date and time, ideal for tags that should expire at the end of a specific event or period.
5. **Type of Tag**: Ensure ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù is selected to mark it as backend-only.
6. **For New Users**: Enable auto-assignment if all new users should automatically receive this tag.
7. **For Existing Users**: Use this setting to apply the tag to all current users if needed.
8. **Save the Tag**: Click **Save** to complete. The tag will now be available in Adminx under System Tags for backend operations.

### Practical Use Cases for System Tags

System Tags offer flexibility and precision for internal management. Below are some examples to illustrate their value:

- **User Spending Behavior**:
    - **#BigSpender**: Use this tag to identify users who frequently make high-value purchases. You could then send them exclusive offers or early access to events as a reward.
    - **#NoSpending**: Tag users who haven‚Äôt made any purchases to target them with promotions or incentives, encouraging them to engage with the platform.
- **Staff and Artist Management**:
    - **#InternalStaff**: This tag allows you to send updates or push notifications exclusively to staff, ensuring operational messages reach the intended audience.
    - **#Artist** or **#VIPGuest**: For events, tag artists or VIP guests separately (or automatically via a voucher that they redeem). This segmentation can help with personalized event access, benefits or backstage management.
- **Membership and Loyalty Programs**:
    - **#Member**: Tag users as members to grant them exclusive privileges, such as discounted tickets or access to members-only content. This can also be used to track and analyze membership behavior for loyalty programs. These tags can also be configured inside a voucher, top-up package & ticket type or imported via ‚ÄúProspects‚Äù onto the platform.

**Tip**: System Tags are powerful for backend segmentation. Use them to refine your audience for operational messages, exclusive access, or targeted promotional campaigns. Regularly update System Tags to ensure accuracy as user behaviors and event requirements evolve.

### Editing or Deleting a System Tag

- **Edit**: Modify tag details by clicking the **Edit** button. You can adjust the expiration, name, or assignment settings.
- **Delete**: Remove the tag by clicking **Delete**, which will permanently dissociate it from all users.

---

### üîÑ Tag Sequences

*Note: Tag Sequences are currently under development and are not functional at this time.*

Tag Sequences will eventually allow for **automated workflows triggered by tag assignments**. This feature is ideal for managing user journeys based on their status or activities. For example, a new user tagged as #NewUser might enter a sequence that sends them onboarding messages or guides them through the platform‚Äôs key features over a series of days.

**Example Use Case for Tag Sequences**:
Once activated, a Tag Sequence could guide users tagged with #VIPGuest through a customized welcome series #step1 - #step2 - etc, introducing them to premium features or exclusive access. This type of automation enhances user engagement and ensures they experience the full value of their VIP status.

## üéØ Segments

Segments in anyKrowd are incredibly versatile and offer powerful ways to categorize, engage, and target specific user groups for various marketing and operational strategies. By using segments, you can create specific audience subsets based on detailed criteria, allowing for personalized engagement that enhances the user experience and drives conversions. This segmentation tool can significantly boost event participation, maximize sales, and deepen user loyalty.

Segments leverage a combination of **Tags**, **Filters**, and **User Attributes**. This enables event organizers and administrators to create audience-specific experiences, whether by offering exclusive deals, customizing content, or delivering specialized notifications.

---

### üîç Why Use Segments?

Segments provide a powerful method to tailor experiences and communication with precision. By setting up segments, you can:

- **Increase Engagement**: Customize notifications and promotions to make them more relevant.
- **Drive Revenue**: Identify high-value customers and offer them exclusive deals, encouraging spending.
- **Build Loyalty**: Reward regular attendees or early adopters with special privileges or access to VIP areas.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Segment staff or volunteers (e.g., #InternalStaff) for targeted communication, ensuring smooth event operations.

These benefits are essential for creating a personalized, impactful event experience that not only meets but exceeds user expectations.

---

### üí° Practical Examples of Segments

To better understand how segments work, here are some real-world examples of segments you might create:

- üõçÔ∏è **High Spenders**: Users who have spent over a specific threshold, such as 100‚Ç¨ on merchandise. This segment is ideal for targeting with exclusive offers like early access to new merch or discounted bundles.
- üï∫ **Music Preferences**: Create segments based on users' music interests by using public tags such as #techno, #house, #urban, and #top50. With this, you can target specific music lovers with event invitations tailored to their favorite genres, improving attendance and satisfaction.

### üìå Tag Assignment in Segments

Tags play a pivotal role in the segmentation process, offering a flexible way to both categorize users and dynamically manage audience groups based on real-time interactions. When setting up segments, tags can be used in two ways:

1. **Filtering on Existing Tags**: If users already have tags assigned to them (e.g., `#techno`, `#BigSpender`), you can filter on these tags to create a segment. This approach is ideal for refining your audience based on their pre-existing preferences or characteristics. Combined with other filters, it allows for highly targeted segment creation.
2. **Assigning Tags in New Segments**: When you create a new segment, you can choose to assign a tag to all users who fall into this segment dynamically. This is a "living" segment, meaning the tag assignment happens in real-time as users meet or leave the criteria of the segment. This feature is especially useful for time-sensitive campaigns or operational needs, as the tag reflects the user's current segment status.

> Note: Tags assigned within a segment remain active for users as long as they are part of the segment. Once they no longer meet the segment criteria, the tag is automatically removed.
> 

---

### üéØ Use Cases for Public and System Tags in Segments

Tags offer a dynamic way to further categorize users within segments, allowing for refined, highly customized targeting:

- **Public Tags**: Visible to users and generally used for personal interests or self-selection. Public tags make it easy to categorize users based on their preferences, enhancing their experience with tailored content and offers. Examples include:
    - `#techno`, `#house`, `#urban`, `#top50` ‚Äì These tags help users select their preferred music styles, which can then be used to notify them about events featuring those genres.
    - **Use Case**: Target users tagged with `#house` for exclusive early-bird tickets to upcoming house music events. This creates a sense of personalization and enhances user engagement.
- **System Tags**: Hidden from users and primarily used for backend segmentation and operational needs. These tags enable efficient management and communication with specific user groups without impacting their visible profile. Examples include:
    - `#BigSpender`: Tag users who have spent significantly, enabling targeted rewards like loyalty discounts or exclusive merchandise offers.
    - `#NoSpending`: Identify users who haven‚Äôt made a purchase, allowing you to design campaigns encouraging their first spend, such as discounts on initial purchases.
    - `#InternalStaff`: This tag is crucial for internal communication, letting you send operational updates only to staff members without confusing other users.
    - `#vipguests`: Segment VIP guests for exclusive access notifications or personalized messages regarding special event privileges.

Using both public and system tags within segments allows for a comprehensive, granular targeting strategy that can significantly enhance user engagement and operational efficiency. Whether for personalized event invitations, operational updates, or exclusive rewards, tags empower you to maintain precise control over user interactions and messaging.

---

### üíæ Saving and Managing New Segments

After configuring the filters:

- **Click Save** to activate the segment.
- This segment will then appear under the **Active** segments list.

It‚Äôs important to keep segments organized and up-to-date. Ensure that each segment serves a clear purpose and aligns with your event goals.

> Pro Tip: Always test segments before launching major campaigns to confirm they meet your criteria. A well-optimized segment setup can save time and improve campaign effectiveness by delivering messages to the right audience.

    - **Specific Groups for Roles**: For example, create separate groups for **staff roles** such as ‚ÄúFront Desk Staff Printers‚Äù and ‚ÄúMerchandise Printers.‚Äù

---

### üéØ Practical Applications of Device Management

The **Device Groups** feature in anyKrowd allows for highly customized and efficient printing setups tailored to the specific needs of your event‚Äôs layout and operational flow. Here are some practical applications:

- **Bar or Location-Specific Printing**: Create a **Device Group** for each bar or location that requires printing services. For example, a group called ‚ÄúMain Bar Printers‚Äù or ‚ÄúVIP Lounge Printers‚Äù can be set up to handle orders specific to these areas. This setup ensures that each bar or location has its own printing workflow, minimizing confusion and improving service speed.
- **Waiter and Bartender Coordination**: Set up a **Device Group** dedicated to each (group of) waiter(s) paired with a specific bartender. This allows the bartender to fulfill tickets exclusively generated by their assigned waiter(s), streamlining order processing and enhancing service coordination. For example, ‚ÄúWaiter Group 1 Printers‚Äù could be set up to route orders directly to a bartender dedicated to that waiter group.
- **Dedicated Printing for Bars, Kitchens, and Cocktail Bars**: Configure separate **Device Groups** for each service area, such as the bar, kitchen, and cocktail bar. By assigning categories or products to these groups (e.g., drinks to the bar, food items to the kitchen, and cocktails to the cocktail bar), each item on an order can print simultaneously in the respective preparation area. This setup allows each section to prepare items in parallel, enhancing order accuracy and reducing wait times for customers.
- **VAT Ticket Reprinting**: Create a **Device Group** specifically for (re)printing VAT tickets. If a visitor requests a physical VAT receipt, you can easily reprint the necessary ticket from a dedicated VAT printer without interrupting other operations. This group can be labeled ‚ÄúVAT Ticket Printers‚Äù for easy identification.
- **ECO Return Points for QR Refunds**: Designate a **Device Group** for ECO Return Points that handle QR Refund printing. This setup allows each ECO Return Point to print receipts with QR codes indicating the eco value, which visitors can scan to request a refund to their bank account. This is particularly useful for events with eco-friendly practices, where attendees can return items and reclaim their eco deposits efficiently.
- **Self-Order Area Support**: Set up **Device Groups** for self-order areas, ensuring that specific printers handle orders from these locations. Dedicated bartenders and runners can then focus on fulfilling orders placed through self-service kiosks or mobile apps. This setup enables faster service in self-order areas and ensures these orders are directed to the correct preparation stations.

---

By leveraging **Device Groups** with these use cases in mind, you can create a seamless and efficient printing infrastructure tailored to your event‚Äôs needs. Each group functions independently, ensuring targeted, accurate printing for different sections and services within your event. Collaborate with the **Field/Operations team** to finalize setups, especially for complex workflows or multiple device integrations.

### **General Settings**

- **User Registration Approval**:
    - Enabling this option activates an approval process for user registrations. Every user account created must be approved by an admin before the user can log in and access the platform. This feature is particularly useful for private communities or exclusive member clubs where access needs to be controlled.
    - ‚ö† **Note**: This feature is still under testing and is currently not widely used.
- **Ask New Users for Interests**:
    - This feature prompts new users to select their interests (based on Public Tags) during signup. Interests are typically used to personalize the user experience in Clientx.
    - You can configure these interests using **Parent Tags** and **Sub-Tags**:
        - **Example Configuration 1**: Set up a **Parent Tag** called `#music` with **Sub-Tags** like `#techno`, `#house`, `#urban`, and `#top50`. Users would first select `#music` as a general interest, and then refine their choice by selecting specific genres from the sub-tags.
        - **Example Configuration 2**: Alternatively, you could create each genre as an individual parent tag (e.g., `#techno`, `#house`), allowing users to select genres directly without a main category.
    - Configuring tags this way enables targeted recommendations, notifications, or event suggestions based on users' selected music preferences. The tag setup can be customized in Adminx to best suit your audience and event needs.
- **Set User Account as Validated on Creation**:
    - Automatically validates every new user account upon creation, bypassing the need for email verification. This allows users immediate access to the platform post-registration without waiting for confirmation. Disabling this option prompts the system to send a verification email upon account creation.
    - ‚ö† **Note**: Social logins (e.g., Facebook, Apple, Google) don‚Äôt require email verification, as validation is managed through the social platform itself.
- **Guest Wallet Creation (Staffx)**:
    - This setting allows staff to add contact details (email and phone number) to a guest wallet created by scanning an unknown RFID. It adds a layer of personalization to guest wallets, making them less anonymous.
    - Example use case: At an event, when a visitor is issued a temporary RFID that isn‚Äôt linked to their account, the staff can create a guest wallet and add identifiable contact information, which could be useful for follow-up communication or customer support.

---

### üéØ Use Cases for Custom Currencies

These use cases illustrate some of the ways event organizers can leverage custom currencies:

- **Default Event Currency**
    - üìå **Purpose**: Acts as the main currency for transactions, such as purchases at food stalls, bars, and merchandise booths.
    - üîß **Configuration**: Set this currency as the **Default Currency** to ensure it is automatically added to each user‚Äôs wallet upon account creation. This designation means it will appear in **ClientX** for all attendees, and it becomes the primary currency for reporting and system automation.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Only one currency can be set as the default. Setting the default currency is crucial, so consult the Project Manager (PM) to confirm the selection, as it impacts reporting and transactions across the platform.
- **Eco Return Token (Refundable Currency)**
    - ‚ôªÔ∏è **Purpose**: Used to promote sustainable practices, like incentivizing attendees to return eco-friendly items, such as cups.
    - üîß **Configuration**: Enable **Refundable Currency** for this token so attendees can reclaim any remaining balance when they return designated items. Use **Refund in Full** to allow full refund eligibility under specific return conditions.
    - üéü **Use Case**: An **Eco Coin** token can encourage environmentally friendly behavior by offering a refund incentive for returned items, adding value to the attendee experience and supporting sustainability goals.
- **Crew or Artist Tokens (Selective Access)**
    - üõ† **Purpose**: Restricted tokens for exclusive benefits for crew members, artists, or other special groups.
    - üîß **Configuration**: **Do not enable Create Automatically** for these tokens. These tokens should be selectively assigned, usually through integrations like ticketing or accreditation, or distributed via vouchers. The wallet for these tokens is created only for specific users as they receive tokens.
    - üëÅ **Visibility**: Set **Show in ClientX** to "Off" to keep the token hidden from general users. Enable **Show in Reporting** to capture any transactions in financial reports.
- **Welcome Drink or Promo Token**
    - üçπ **Purpose**: A one-time-use token that provides a complimentary item (e.g., a drink) as a reward for certain actions, like downloading the app or registering early.
    - üîß **Configuration**: Set as **non-refundable** and enable **Show in ClientX** so attendees can view it in their wallet. **Top-uppable** should be disabled, as this is intended to be a single-use incentive.
    - üéÅ **Use Case**: A **Welcome Drink Token** can reward users for engaging with the platform, such as downloading the app, while encouraging further interaction at the event.
- **Birthday Coin for Celebrations**
    - üéÇ **Purpose**: A special currency for attendees celebrating a birthday, redeemable for perks like a free drink or exclusive item.
    - üîß **Configuration**: Set the **ClientX Order** to prioritize this token‚Äôs visibility during the attendee‚Äôs birthday period. The token should be configured to expire after the birthday celebration to prevent misuse.
    - üåü **Example**: A **Birthday Coin** could be valid only during the birthday timeframe, allowing users to enjoy a unique perk in honor of their special day.
- **VIP Comfort Token**
    - üëë **Purpose**: A premium currency for VIP guests, granting access to complimentary items or specific areas, enhancing the VIP experience.
    - üîß **Configuration**: Set a **Burning Weight** to ensure that this token is used first if multiple currencies are available. **ClientX Order** should also be configured to make this currency highly visible in VIP wallets.
    - üåü **Example**: VIP attendees may use a **Comfort Token** for free or discounted items, prioritizing their access and improving their event experience.

### üëÄ Overview of Currencies

The **Overview of Currencies** page provides a list of all created currencies, with action buttons to **Edit** or **Delete** each currency. While these functions are straightforward, it‚Äôs essential to understand that any adjustments made here can impact the live event experience and financial reporting.

- **Edit**: Opens the **Edit Currency** page, where you can modify all settings for a specific currency. Changes applied here, such as adjusting visibility or updating the burning weight, will reflect in real time.
- **Delete**: Permanently removes a currency from the system. Deleting a currency can have major implications on reports, user balances, and event flow. **Consult the PM** before deleting any currency to avoid disruptions.

### Create New Currency: Detailed Guide

Creating a new currency in anyKrowd involves setting up various configurations to ensure that it aligns with your event‚Äôs specific requirements. Each option below has a unique function that controls how the currency will behave within ClientX, StaffX, and reporting. This guide provides detailed descriptions to help you make informed decisions about each setting.

---

### Currency Configuration Options

1. **Name, Prefix, and Suffix**
    - **Name**: The full name of the currency, which is mandatory for identification (e.g., ‚ÄúFestival Coin‚Äù or ‚ÄúEco Token‚Äù).
    - **Prefix**: The symbol that represents the currency, such as an emoji, letter, or character (e.g., ‚Ç¨, CR, or üç∫). This helps users quickly recognize the currency in transactions.
    - **Suffix**: Optional field that allows for an additional label after the currency amount (e.g., ‚ÄúEUR‚Äù or ‚ÄúUSD‚Äù). This is useful when distinguishing among multiple currency types.
2. **Default Currency**
    - **Purpose**: Sets this currency as the main, default currency for all users. The Default Currency is automatically added to every user's wallet upon account creation.
    - **Configuration**: Only one currency can be marked as the default. This designation is critical for operational consistency, as it becomes the primary currency for all automated processes, reporting, and transactions.
    - **Consultation**: **Discuss with your Project Manager (PM)** to confirm the choice of default currency, as this selection affects reporting and overall platform behavior.
    - **Example**: If "Festival Coin" is chosen as the default currency, it will appear in all users‚Äô wallets by default and be used as the primary currency for purchases.
3. **Refundable Currency**
    - **Definition**: When enabled, this setting allows users to request a refund of any **unspent balance** in their wallet. This feature is especially useful for refundable transactions or deposits.
    - **Mechanics**: The refund amount is capped at the original topped-up amount. For example, if a user topped up ‚Ç¨50 but accumulated an additional ‚Ç¨100 through returns (such as Eco Tokens), they can only refund the topped-up ‚Ç¨50 unless "Refund in Full" is enabled.
    - **Usage in Eco Programs**: For tokens like **Eco Coins**, this configuration helps to ensure refunds are only issued based on actual topped-up amounts, providing an incentive for eco-friendly actions (e.g., cup returns) without overextending refund capabilities.
    - **Important**: Carefully evaluate whether this setting aligns with your event‚Äôs policies, especially for tokens that can be "farmed" or accumulated (such as eco incentives).
4. **Refund Currency in Full**
    - **Purpose**: This setting, when enabled, allows the entire balance in the wallet to be refunded, bypassing the capped refund based on the topped-up amount.
    - **Best Use**: Ideal for scenarios like **Volunteer Tokens** or eco-friendly programs where users are assured of a full refund upon meeting specific return conditions, such as returning all issued tokens or items.
    - **Example**: For events where attendees are guaranteed a full refund (e.g., returning rental items or eco-friendly cups), enabling "Refund Currency in Full" ensures the entire amount in the currency wallet is eligible for refund.
5. **Show Currency in Reporting**
    - **Functionality**: Determines whether transactions using this currency appear in financial reports.
    - **Best Practice**: Enable for currencies tied to financial transactions or event revenue, such as general admission tokens or food and beverage currencies. For promotional tokens, such as free drink vouchers, consider disabling this option to avoid clutter in reports.
6. **Show Currency in ClientX**
    - **Purpose**: Controls the visibility of this currency in users' wallets within ClientX.
    - **Use Case**: Enable for general-purpose tokens that attendees need to see, like the main event currency. For specialized tokens (e.g., Crew Tokens or Artist Tokens), disable visibility to keep them hidden from general users.
    - **Example**: Display "Festival Coin" to all attendees, but hide "Crew Token" to limit access to specific user groups.
7. **Top-uppable**
    - **Definition**: Allows users to add funds to this currency through ClientX or StaffX.
    - **Best Use**: Enable for commonly used currencies, such as the main event currency, to allow continuous top-ups. Disable for one-time-use or promotional tokens, such as complimentary drink vouchers.
    - **Example**: Enable top-up for "Festival Coin" to facilitate user spending throughout the event. For a token like "Welcome Drink," disable top-up to limit usage to the initial allocation only.
8. **Create Automatically**
    - **Purpose**: Automatically creates a wallet for this currency in each user‚Äôs account upon registration.
    - **Recommended Use**: Enable only for essential currencies, such as the Default Currency, which should be present in every attendee‚Äôs wallet. For selective tokens (e.g., Crew Tokens or Artist Tokens), **do not enable** this feature. These tokens should be manually distributed via vouchers, ticketing, or integrations as needed.
    - **Important Note**: Use this setting for universally required currencies only, such as the main currency needed by all users. **Selective tokens** like Crew Tokens should be distributed manually to avoid unnecessary wallet creation.
9. **Exchange Rate (versus Default Currency)**
    - **Purpose**: Sets the exchange rate between this currency and the default FIAT currency (Euro).
    - **Application**: Carefully adjust this rate based on event financial strategies. For example, if 1 token = ‚Ç¨1.18, configure the exchange rate accordingly to maintain accurate reporting.
    - **Impact**: Incorrect exchange rates can lead to discrepancies in top-ups and financial tracking. Always double-check these values for accuracy.
10. **Burning Weight**
    - **Definition**: Determines the priority of currency usage when multiple currencies are available in a user's wallet.
    - **Use Case**: Essential for events with tiered currencies, such as VIP or premium tokens, where organizers may want to prioritize these over general tokens.
    - **Example**: Assign a lower burning weight to "VIP Token" to ensure it is used before "Festival Coin," enhancing the VIP experience by granting prioritized access to premium benefits.
11. **ClientX Order** and **StaffX Order**
    - **Purpose**: Defines the display order of currencies within the ClientX and StaffX wallets, allowing organizers to control which tokens appear at the top of the list.
    - **Use Case**: Set primary tokens to appear at the top for better user experience. For VIP experiences, position premium tokens prominently to enhance accessibility.
    - **Example**: Place "Festival Coin" first for general users, but prioritize "VIP Token" for VIP wallets, making it easily accessible for premium users.
12. **Description**
    - **Function**: Allows for additional context or messaging related to the currency, visible in the wallet.
    - **Best Practice**: Clearly explain the purpose or redemption conditions for the currency. For example, for **Eco Tokens**, add a note like ‚ÄúRefundable upon eco-friendly item return‚Äù to ensure users understand the redemption rules.
    - **Benefit**: Descriptions help reduce confusion, especially for tokens with specific use cases, by providing transparency on how and when they can be redeemed.
    
    Ignore the bottom part ‚ÄúSpending Limits‚Äù this is a functionality that is not working for the moment and not in use.

### FIAT Currency

- **Definition**: The FIAT currency in anyKrowd is set to Euro (‚Ç¨) by default, serving as the base currency for all token exchanges and reports.
- **Purpose**: This standard FIAT currency creates a reliable reference point for all currency conversions within the platform, allowing each custom token to be linked back to a real-world Euro value for accurate reporting and analytics.
- **Limitations**: Currently, the platform supports only one FIAT currency, which is set to Euro (‚Ç¨). Future updates may enable the use of multiple FIAT currencies.

---

### Configuring Exchange Rates for Custom Tokens

Exchange rates determine how each token translates into Euro (‚Ç¨) values in your reports. Properly configuring exchange rates allows you to control whether a token's usage reflects as revenue, as well as how it affects financial insights. Here are some key configurations and their specific use cases:

- **Exchange Rate of 1**:
    - **Example**: Setting an exchange rate of `1` means each token is equal to ‚Ç¨1.
    - **Use Case**: Commonly used for standard event currencies, such as a "Festival Coin," where each token reflects a true Euro equivalent. For instance, if a cocktail costs 10 Festival Coins, this would add ‚Ç¨10 to your sales revenue if the token‚Äôs exchange rate is set to 1.
    - **Impact**: When the exchange rate is 1, the total value of tokens spent will be fully reflected in revenue reports, aligning token spending directly with Euro values.
- **Exchange Rate Variations**:
    - **Example - 0.5**: Setting an exchange rate of `0.5` means each token is valued at ‚Ç¨0.50.
    - **Use Case**: Useful for tokens with a lower perceived value or specific promotional currencies, such as a ‚ÄúDiscount Coin‚Äù that reduces the cost per item. This configuration allows organizers to offer tokens at a discount while maintaining visibility in financial reports.
    - **Example - 1.5**: An exchange rate of `1.5` means each token represents ‚Ç¨1.50.
    - **Use Case**: This higher value might be used for VIP tokens or tokens granted through a premium package, where spending each token has a more substantial impact, reflecting a premium experience or product.
- **Exchange Rate of 0**:
    - **Purpose**: Setting the exchange rate to `0` makes the token **value-neutral in reports**. This ensures that token usage does not inflate sales revenue, while still tracking engagement.
    - **Use Case - Free Tokens**: If you want to offer complimentary tokens as part of a promotion or reward, such as giving 10 Free Tokens equivalent to ‚Ç¨10 in value, setting an exchange rate of `0` will ensure these tokens do not add to revenue totals. For instance, if attendees redeem Free Tokens for a ‚Ç¨10 cocktail, it will not be counted as ‚Ç¨10 in sales, keeping financial reports accurate.
    - **Alternative Use**: For instances where you wish to track free tokens as though they had revenue impact, you could set the exchange rate to `1`. In this case, giving out 10 Free Tokens would add ‚Ç¨10 to revenue reports, even though they were distributed without actual payment. This approach might be useful for tracking the potential value of promotions.

---

### Special Use Cases for Exchange Rates

- **Welcome Drink Token**:
    - **Purpose**: A one-time-use token meant to offer attendees a complimentary item, such as a welcome drink.
    - **Configuration**: Set the exchange rate to `0` so that each use of the Welcome Drink Token does not add to revenue, allowing you to keep these promotions separate from actual sales revenue.
    - **Impact**: This approach provides a clean separation between promotional giveaways and actual sales, keeping your revenue reporting focused on paid transactions.
- **Free Tokens for Event-Wide Use**:
    - **Purpose**: Tokens distributed to attendees for spending on event items, without costing them directly.
    - **Configuration**: If these Free Tokens are given on a 1:1 basis, meaning they are intended to be spent like real money, you have the option to either set their exchange rate to `1` or `0`:
        - **Exchange Rate 1**: If you set it to `1`, each Free Token redeemed will add its Euro equivalent to the total sales revenue. For example, if an attendee redeems 10 Free Tokens on a ‚Ç¨10 cocktail, ‚Ç¨10 will be recorded as revenue.
        - **Exchange Rate 0**: If set to `0`, these tokens will not contribute to sales revenue totals, accurately reflecting that no real money was exchanged.
    - **Choosing the Configuration**: The choice between `1` and `0` depends on how you want these tokens reflected in your reports. Setting the exchange rate to `1` might be useful for tracking the full potential value of what you‚Äôve given out, while setting it to `0` accurately keeps it separate from actual revenue.

---

### Understanding Exchange Rate Mechanics in Reporting

- **Revenue Impact**: Exchange rate settings directly affect how each token appears in your financial reports. Tokens with exchange rates of `1` or higher will contribute to your total sales, while those set to `0` remain revenue-neutral.
- **Flexible Reporting**: Custom exchange rates allow you to adjust the perceived and reported value of tokens to match the intended event experience, whether it‚Äôs premium VIP access, complimentary perks, or eco-friendly incentives.

By carefully configuring exchange rates, organizers can ensure that tokens serve their intended purpose without compromising the accuracy of revenue data. This customization is key to aligning event operations with financial reporting goals and maximizing flexibility in token usage.

## üìç Locations

The **Locations** module in the anyKrowd platform serves as the central management hub for defining physical or operational spaces within an event. Accurate configuration of locations is essential for effective reporting, ensuring that revenue and activities are correctly attributed to specific areas. When setting up locations, it‚Äôs advised to work closely with the PM to maintain consistency and avoid errors.

---

### üìú Overview of all Locations

In the **Locations** overview, you can see a list of all created locations along with an action button to **Edit** or **Delete** each entry. Each location can also include sublocations, allowing a hierarchical organization of areas within the event. For instance:

- A **main area** could be a large venue zone such as ‚ÄúArtist Village.‚Äù
- **Sublocations** within this zone might include distinct bars, food trucks, or merch stands (e.g., ‚ÄúBar 1 ‚Äì Artist VIP,‚Äù ‚ÄúFoodtruck 2 ‚Äì Artist Village‚Äù).

Including distinct names for main and sublocations is highly recommended for clarity in **AdminX** (locations, catalogs, onboarding configurations) and to streamline reporting in dashboards. For example:

- **FOODCOURT | Burgers**
- **MAIN STAGE | Champagne Bar**

Creating clear, detailed location names helps keep operational areas organized and enhances overall reporting accuracy.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Location Management Actions

1. **Edit**: Allows you to modify existing locations. This opens the same form as the **Create New Location** page, enabling changes to names, parent locations, and more.
2. **Delete**: Permanently removes a location. Exercise caution, as deleted locations cannot be restored and could impact historical data in reporting.
3. **Bin**: Temporarily removes a location and can be recovered if needed, making it safer than a permanent deletion.

---

### ‚ûï Create New Location

Clicking the **+Create** button allows you to define a new location within your event setup. When creating a location, you will need to configure specific parameters:

- **Name**: Assign a unique and descriptive name for the location.
- **Parent Location**: If the new location is a sub-area within a larger space, select a pre-existing **Parent Location**. To set a location as a parent, first create and save it, then add child locations as sublocations.
- **Default Location**: Enable this setting if you want this location to serve as the fallback default for staffX users without an assigned location. **Note**: This setting is critical for cases where no other specific location is linked.

Locations are predominantly applied in **Onboarding** processes. By assigning locations to specific **QR codes**, you ensure that staffX devices and logins are activated at the correct locations. Any revenue generated by a device at this location will be tagged accordingly, enabling precise filtering in reports and dashboards.

---

### üìã Practical Setup Examples

To illustrate, here are some sample setups that demonstrate practical location configurations:

1. **Main Event Areas**:
    - Example: **Food Court** with multiple sublocations such as ‚ÄúBar 3.1 ‚Äì Foodcourt‚Äù and ‚ÄúPizza Saporito.‚Äù
    - These sublocations assist in tracking sales and operational flow within the designated food service zone.
2. **Artist VIP Zones**:
    - Example: **Artist Village** with sublocations like ‚ÄúBar 1 ‚Äì Artist VIP‚Äù or ‚ÄúMerch Stand ‚Äì Artist Area.‚Äù
    - Separate sublocations within a VIP or restricted area provide granular tracking of activity within exclusive sections.
3. **Sustainability Initiatives**:
    - Example: **Eco Cup Return Point** within the venue.
    - Locations such as ‚ÄúEco Point 1‚Äù allow tracking of specific activities, such as sustainable product returns, adding value to eco-reporting efforts.

These examples demonstrate how setting up parent and child locations can improve organizational clarity and ensure that financial data is accurately aligned with event areas.

# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èStaffx 
(the naming of our Staff facing / POS environment)

## General

Staffx is the core tool that is used on-site, at the Venue, or at the event.

Where AdminX is mainly the tool for an organizer (admin) or anyKrowd crew member to configure and manage the platform, and ClientX is the tool that used by the visitor, StaffX is the tool that is used by crew members / staff members on-site at the event.

Crew members, often volunteers, often arrive right on time (or late) for the event and need to be trained in a short period of time to learn to work with the software / their part of the software, to do their job on-site. StaffX is the portable management tool that crew members can use on-site. It‚Äôs driven by adminx‚Äôs configuration, like sales catalogues, roles & permissions, onboarding qr‚Äôs, that eventually allow a user to easily onboard onto the staffx platform and is using it for it‚Äôs role at the event on-site, wether it‚Äôsa bartender, barmanager, ticket checkin staff, somebody from the accreditation, or the organization itself with an admin login or onboarding qr code with full permissions to do a little bit of everything and keep track of reports, staffx can do it all if configured properly. Do this together with your PM. To loginto Staffx, you need a domain name (tenant nameslug - same as clientx) + email + password to login or scan an onboarding qr that gives you the correct rights. You can fill these credentials in manually if you have a staffx account, or create an onboarding qr for your account to login onto staffx. This is the best way to do it, so you can give an ANYKROWD location to anykrowd-staff qr codes so everything is logged of anykrowd actions under an anykrowd location tag. This is the cleanest way and should always be advised to create / have for every project so that anyKrowd crew members that are on-site supporting all can scan this and use staffx correctly.

Once logged in, you need to select an event to work on. Either the events are created, or there is a ‚ÄúGLOBAL SALES EVENT‚Äù configured to process all the sales on. This mainly used for venues or locations that open frequently so that you don‚Äôt always need to change events every openingday before you start and onboarding qr‚Äôs can be configured once and stay that way and keep working. Otherwise if you work with unique events every time, you need to reprogram the onboarding qr‚Äôs (as they are event related). Something to discuss with the PM. Once an (active) event is selected, you are on the homescreen of staffx. This screen has buttons with chapters. The visibility of these buttons depend on the role/permissions your account has. If you have full permissions, you will see all the buttons like the screenshot below. Clicking any of these buttons will open that specific chapter. Clicking the top right HOME button will return you to this screen (home / dashboard) and clicking the LOGOUT button (topright) will log you out back to the starting screen. In this case, the staffx is logged in on the tenant JEUX D‚ÄôHIVER (recognizable by the logo at the top) for the event GLOBAL SALES EVENT (noticed by the visual at the top, this is the event visual main image). These differ for each event offcourse as they are fully customizable by adminx. In the bottom you see which staff account is currently logged in and on which email and below that is a button ‚ÄúASSIGN RFID‚Äù - a user can click this button and then tap an RFID wristband/card against the staffx device to attach this rfid to the user account. Allowing it to login, if you get logged out, you can click ‚ÄúLOGIN WITH RFID‚Äù and login with your RFID that was previously attached. If an RFID is attached, you will see a button ‚ÄúDETACH RFID‚Äù instead and clicking it will allow you to detach the RFID from your account.

‚ÄúLocation‚Äù is usually set within an onboarding qr so it‚Äôs added to the staffx upon login in .

‚Äúchange event‚Äù is to select a different event, return to the screen before arriving on the dashboard, where you select an (active) event

‚Äúchange location‚Äù is only shown if you have the permission and not shown if you don‚Äôt - this is to manually change your location, we advise not to use this but to use onboarding qr for every re-login.

![](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/0178d42c-1f47-4a8e-8a8c-b4accdb13c77/image7.png)

## 

## Entrance

This is the entrance chapter of Staffx. This is mainly used for staff/crew members that work at the entrance of the event or venue and need check-in features. This chapter is used to check-in visitors. Access Control. You can checkin a user if they have a ticket for the event selected. This can be an integrated, imported or anyKrowd entrance ticket, like a guestlist registration for example. It can be or can not be personalised. So you can search in the searchbar on name and email and this will check the attendee list (as can be found via AdminX/Manage/Events/Attendees) to look up for a user and select the user to manually check-in if necessary. The main functionality of this screen is the ‚ÄúSCAN QR‚Äù button that will trigger to open the camera + activate the infrared reader (if applicable on device, like for example the L2s, samsungs don‚Äôt have this feature on the hardware) to scan a ticket qr code. Not only can it scan ticket qr codes, it can only scan personal qr codes, if this feature is activated in Adminx/App/Settings . In this case it can also scan & check-in personal qr codes. Once it‚Äôs scanned, if it‚Äôs valid & first time checked in, you will see a successful screen (green box) to indicate the checkin was successful + show some information + a timestamp of checkin. If the ticket is valid but already used, you will see a popup that the user was already check-ed in. If the qr code is not valid you will receive a red error box. The goal of this chapter is to check-in users via tickets or personal qr‚Äôs. Your attendees checked in vs expected (tickets) is shown next to Guests: x / x.

### Ticket / Personal QR scanning

Clicking the SCAN QR button allows a user to start scanning for a QR code (can be ticket / personal qr code) to check-in the guest(user). See description above. On the checkin screen after checking in a personal qr you will see the extra option to ban/block temporarily this user. This is mainly used by doormen/hosts at the entrance of a nightclub to monitor how many guests are inside and have the option to ban/block a user for misbehaviour. You will have the option to enter a reason and confirm. When user checks in again, he will have a orange or red color instead of green to signal there is a ban/block active for this user.

### Sell Remote

This is a feature that needs to be enabled in the ticket type configuration of specific ticket types in order to activate the option to sell tickets remotely. Once a ticket type has this activated, a button will appear on a staffx / event / entrance that has this ticket type added to the event, a button will appear ‚Äúsell tickets remotely‚Äù in the entrance chapter. Clicking this button will allow you to ‚Äúsell‚Äù this ticket type via the payment methods activated. You can also enable the settings to activate an email field for this. this way it can for example also be used for ‚ÄúGuestlist‚Äù tickets, that you ‚Äúsell remotely‚Äù via email for free. The recipient of a remote sale will receive an email about this with the ticket downloadable in .pdf and a button to discover the ticket on the (web)app clientx. This functionality is used for example by Den Glade Vikingn (DGV) for their street promo team that is selling tickets (cash / card / with dgv app) on the streets but always ask an email at checkout. This way the recipient receives ticket via email, and DGV is farming email addresses for every ticketsale on the street and the users are prompted up front to discover the DGV app and already onboard before going to the club and benefit from the app benefits and promotions that are only available there. It‚Äôs tools like this that can greatly help the boost / creation of a community.

### Sell at door

Sell at the door works the exact same way as sell remote , but the difference is that that doorsale tickets are checked in at the moment of purchase. There is no qr code that can be checked in at a later moment or location, it‚Äôs checked in at the moment of purchase, better for the scenario where you want to sell entrance fees and let the user in right away or give him a proof of entrance (like a stamp or bracelet) or something like that to get in. In this case there is no need to generate a ticket and the user can just enter the location. The email field that can be added if you want is to farm email addresses for every checkout, your choice.

### Search user or ticket

As described above under ‚ÄúEntrance‚Äù.

### Expected guests vs. Checked in guest

A summary view of the total expected and already checked-in persons. giving you a real time view of who is in, and who is still to be expected.

## Sales

This is the POS system within anyKrowd. It‚Äôs configured by AdminX/Sales mainly and works as the tool for the crew to make sales. These can be F&B sales, a merchandise stand, an ice scream shop, or a ticket vendor at the entrance, whatever you are selling you can configure in the anyKrowd sales system. En sales catalogue must be chosen to be able to perform sales. If no sales catalogue is selected, it auto selects the default one or prompts you to select a sales catalogue. Sales catalogues are also configured inside an onboarding qr, to easily onboard multiple locations with multiple different sales catalogues on fresh devices just given to a crew member. If alles is correct, you will see a sortlike screen like the screenshot below, of a sales catalogue. To select a different sales catalogue, hold & press the SALES button on the home / dashboard screen to select a different catalogue. Note this functionality is not preferred to use like that, because the location tag does not travel with you if you change sales catalogues like this on your device, it‚Äôs always best to use an onboarding qr code to login onto a new device / catalogue / location because all the correct info sits in the onboarding qr code so that is the preferred method to login a new device or to switch locations. Logout + log back in with new onboarding qr code at the new location is the preferred way to handle these movements.

At the top left we have the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button to go back to the dashboard / home page.

At the top right there are 2 smaller buttons shown.

The ‚Äú?‚Äù is to check balance of a rfid that is presented by a visitor. Click the ‚Äú?‚Äù icon and scan an RFID wristband or card to check the balance on that RFID. A smaller popup at the top of the screen will appear saying what is left on the RFID wallet.

The ‚Äúprinter‚Äù icon at the topright, is only shown to logged in staff accounts that have the ‚Äúprinter toggle‚Äù permission. This is a toggle that allows you to turn on/off printing for this specific device. You have to hold the button for 5+ seconds to toggle it from red/green (off/on).

Then we see the categories. Categories are created in adminx/sales inside a catalogue and can be named whatever and have an image uploaded as you can see in the example above. We have categories ‚Äútips‚Äù ‚Äúalcool + wines‚Äù ‚Äúcocktails‚Äù etc . Clicking on a catalogue opens the catalogue and shows its products

![](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/4e95510a-a301-4590-ade6-1742a73317fa/image16.png)

To select a product a user needs to click on the product to add quantity +1. To remove a product, click on the ‚Äúnumber‚Äù to decrease the quantity -1. This is very intu√Øtive to work with, just click on products to add, click on the numbers to decrease, simple. You can add products from different categories and these all add up to the same order. The total of your order can be seen in the bottom left corner. If you click on that, you will open the order detail view. Showing an overview of the total order + the payment options to checkout. The payment options buttons are only shown if they are activated in App/Settings and the staff user has the correct permissions to accept these. In the screenshots below my user has all permissions enabled

![](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/221902f3-42b4-4c73-a2ea-a158165b866b/image18.png)

To process the order, in this view simply click the payment option to continue to process / finalise the order or close this screen and then you are back on the main screen with the orange bar in the bottom. The bottom shows the total of the order as mentioned above, and the right bottom side in the bar shows the quickbuttons to the payment buttons. Clicking them will activate the payment. If you click card, you will be prompted to accept the cardpayment and confirm if you have received it (on your own external terminal) or the viva app will be opened is card present payments is enabled and the payment can process directly via staffx + viva , once the payment is completed in viva , you will be returned to staffx and see the user confirmation screen of a successful payment, the contents of the order, and the remaining wallet balance + transactionlog of the order to the user in an inverted display so you can tilt your device, so it‚Äôs readable for the customer and you as staff member can use the rest of the green confirmation screen to see an overview of your order that you just processed as a crew member.

If you click cash, you will be prompted to confirm that you have received the cash, then you will process the order and receive the confirmation screen.

If you click the RFID icon, the RFID reader will be activated, if you then hold a RFID it will read the RFID and show you a successful return screen if there is money on the wallet left, or a ‚Äúnot enough money‚Äù return screen (red) if the wallet balance is to low on this RFID wallet attached to process / complete this order. More information will be shown on the return screen to identify the issue / what is missing and either solve the configuration error (if it‚Äôs an error, like a price variation missing for a certain currency type) or tell the visitor to topup more money in order to be able to complete the transaction.

If you click the QR button in the bottom right orange bar, the QR camera and/or infrared will be prompted / start scanning (depending on the settings in Staffx/Settings) to scan a personal qr code of a clientx (web)app. If the QR code scanned is valid and have money, the same applies ase written above in regards to RFID payment.

Eco Cups, and the whole ‚Äúwarranty return‚Äù principle are also handled in Staffx Sales. For this there is a ‚Äúwarranty return‚Äù category that can contain a warranty return product, for example an Eco Cup. In this warranty return category, usually named ‚ÄúECO‚Äù with a recycle icon, is used to give back / return eco cups to a visitor. For example the eco cup costs 2‚Ç¨ but can be returned, then a warranty return (credited sales) needs to occur, giving back the 2‚Ç¨ on this users wallet for bringing the eco cup back. Depending on the configuration and eco policy of currencies, this can vary and be different for multple tenants or events configurations. Good practices must be explained and followed.

Clicking the little red trashcan icon/button on staffx sales will prompt to clear the order so you can start fresh.

## Users

This is the chapter to handle everything regarding users on-site and is mainly used by the top-up crew.

The user chapter allows a crew member to identify a visitor via User QR or RFID, or use the search bar to search for users (name / email). the search bar can be useful in case a visitor loses it‚Äôs phone, crew member can search of the user, find it‚Äôs wallet, link a (new) rfid wristband/card and this becomes an extension of the wallet and the visitor can continue with it‚Äôs journey and use this rfid to pay with an existing wallet. When the phone battery is back, he can check the spendings after etc all functionalities remain, the RFID is an extension of a clientx (guest) wallet. Clicking the ‚ÄúUser QR‚Äù button will trigger the device to scan for a personal qr - when a valid one is scanned, the user detail window pops open with the features for the staff member to use. these features are also permission driven so it depends on the role / permissions what buttons you see here and can be used on this staff account. in this example I have full permissions and I just scanned a user qr of my account.

Click ‚ÄúUser QR‚Äù + Scan Personal QR code of ‚ÄúMichael-David Passy‚Äù

![](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/eeaa71f4-9c82-4e3f-aaf0-73a91fe4fe65/image23.png)

![](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/aee454b3-e845-4bd5-92b8-76eba3b73b52/image14.png)

This opens the user detail page of in this case ‚ÄúMichael-David Passy‚Äù - we see that I have 6‚Ç¨ on my wallet and we see all the buttons / features that i can now do as a crew member.

- Top Up - to add money to the wallet , this can be packages or free input amount, paid by cash or card, this money is added to the wallet of this user. to topup money as staffx for a visitor, select a package or enter an amount, and then click the cash or card button to chose your payment method. If card present payments are enabled, pressing card will trigger the viva app to open and process the payment. a confirmation screen will be shown if the topup was successful and the money will be added to the user / rfid wallet.
- Link - if you want to link an (extra) RFID to this user. Click the button and scan an RFID to attach an (extra) RFID to this account. An RFID can have multiple rfid‚Äôs connected.
- Voucher - to add a voucher to this user - you will need a voucher (qr) code to redeem the voucher (created in Adminx/Manage/Vouchers)
- Accreditation - feature that can be used for accreditation purposes to scan a (external partner) QR code like from Eventication. This needs to be detailed further. Check this with your PM
- Refund - if you want to perform a staffx refund on this user - let‚Äôs say this user wants the 6‚Ç¨ back in cash, you can decide to refund this user, give 6‚Ç¨ in cash, and the wallet will be put to 0‚Ç¨. A cost can be configured in Adminx/App/Settings for this service if you want
- History - clicking this button will open the history screen; It‚Äôs similar to the clientx transaction detail log of a user, it shows the transactions done, and if you click it you open it for more detail. This is useful is an error has happened on-site and a visitor claims there has been a mistake, a crew member can check the history / transactions and spot the error and then manually correct it with either a top-up, voucher, or update order, depending on the policy on how to correct mistakes at this specific event. Multiple ways to do it. More staffx (sales) best practices should be written and added to the Kodex.

## Zone

Requires more explanation from Julien to describe this feature best

## Warranty return

This is a separate chapter for warranty returns. This is mostly not used anymore for the moment as warranty return can be configured inside a sales catalogue, in a warranty return category. This is mostly done by bar crew that work in the staffx sales module anyway so they don‚Äôt need a separate chapter warranty return to handle this. This chapter can (if it does not get removed) still be used if there is a warranty return point that only handles returns - this can be a permission inside a role that you create on adminx/manage/staff. If used this chapter allows you to return warranty return products and return (add) money on the wallet in return for these products. If the warranty return price is 2‚Ç¨ for an eco cup and a user brings back 10 cups, the wallet gets 20‚Ç¨. In which currency or if refundable depends on the configurations of the currencies and warranty return price variation. To be checked with a PM.

## Activity

This chapter is the activity log. On this chapter, if you have the permission to access this, you can search for transactions, staff, users, in order to find a transaction. You can then open this transaction in detail and (if you have the permissoin) update the order to make adjustments and corrections if a mistake has happened. For example if a user was charged 2 beers instead of one, someone with the activity & update order permission can look up this transaction via activity and update the order, remove 1 beer, so that 1 beer is refunded / added to the wallet of the user that made the order. This is a permission / feature usually given to a barmanager or a champion of the organization because you don‚Äôt want this feature enabled for every bartender as it can also be used fraudulently so this must be profiles that you trust. The button ‚Äúshow my activity‚Äù allows you to filter on your activity only instead of the full / all activity. Showing only your transactions / transactions done on this staff device / account compared to seeing all transactions from everyone accounts / all devices. The buttons ‚ÄúCash‚Äù ‚ÄúCard‚Äù and ‚ÄúWallet‚Äù allow you to filter on payment type that you select. Swiping an order should trigger to reprint an order.

![](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66393916-3dd6-4b7f-ae81-699eed5fab5a/de196a1d-d844-495e-862c-95ef6a2e1236/image3.png)

## Printer

Not used for the moment (to be validated with operations/field). Main purpose for this was to have a visual ‚Äúorder flow‚Äù of incoming orders and the option to reprint / mark orders as done. For when printers would break down you have a visual overview of all orders processed by devices / self-order so that you can mark which ones are done / and slide them to reprint the ticket (if needed) but this chapter is currently not used for the moment as you can also reprint via the activity chapter.

## Day Reporting

This chapter allows you to check your day reports on your staffx device if you have the permission. You can check day reports (in detail) and swipe them to print them on the default printer. This prints out your day total so you have a printed copy.

## Staff Reporting

This chapter allows you to check your staff reports on your staffx device if you have the permission to do so. You can check staff reports from active staff. Only active staff profiles for this event will be shown. click on a staff name to open the detailed report or ‚Äúswipe‚Äù it in order to trigger to print it on the default printer.

## Settings

Clicking this button opens the Settings chapter of Staffx. In here you are able to configure some settings for your device.

- Default QR Scanner : select which default scanner should be selected for scanning qr codes . Select camera so you don‚Äôt always have to click on the ‚Äúcamera‚Äù icon on staffx before you scan a qr code. use ‚Äúir‚Äù if you work with an l2s and use infrared as main scan option. none for none, the option to do them manually is always available.
- Mounted mode : feature not ready yet / fully functional / in use - this feature would allow you to have mounted mode enable and have all payments methods always listening so you can improve the speed or working behind the bars by having all options always on. further improvements / updates might be required before you can use this functionality
- Display User Confirmation : if you enable this, you show a user confirmation screen to show to the customer after staffx sales has processed an error. if the screen is not showing, this setting should be turned on
- Invert User Display : the option to invert the user confirmation screen so that it is easy to use at the bar - so you can tilt your device - and have a part readable for you and a confirmation screen inverted readable for the customer.
- the button in the bottom ‚Äúclear app data‚Äù - if staffx is experiencing an issue, clicking this button clears the cache memory and forces the user to login again. Clicking this buton, then manually closing (killing) the app and re-opening it (StaffX if V1, Staffx MC if V2) on the device and then logging back in (via an onboarding qr code) is usually the best quick fix for 90+% of the problems. Log/out back in, hard close / reopen your app, click the ‚Äúclear app data‚Äù button and do the above, combination of these, should do the trick for most issues that (can) happen on site and is something that should be the first reaction for most issues / cases.
