# Story 0.3: CLI Command Interface Implementation

## Status: Complete

## User Story
**As a** TestX developer and user
**I want** a comprehensive CLI interface with testx commands
**So that** I can manage services, run tests, and perform operations from the command line

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] CLI entry point (`src/cli/index.ts`) with proper shebang and executable setup
- [x] Command parser using Commander.js with structured command hierarchy
- [x] Core commands: `run`, `setup`, `status`, `create`, `record`, `analyze`
- [x] Service management commands: `testx setup slack`, `testx setup notion`, `testx setup github`
- [x] Test execution commands: `testx run clientx auth`, `testx run clientx wallet`
- [x] Status commands: `testx status --global`, `testx status --services`
- [x] Help system with detailed command documentation
- [x] Error handling with AI-friendly logging
- [x] Integration with existing service integration system
- [x] TypeScript compilation and proper bin setup in package.json

## Technical Requirements
- Use Commander.js for command parsing and structure
- Integrate with existing service integration system from Story 0.2
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow CLI best practices with proper exit codes
- Support for global flags: `--verbose`, `--quiet`, `--json`
- Colored output using chalk for better UX
- Loading indicators using ora for long-running operations

## Implementation Tasks
- [x] Create CLI entry point (`src/cli/index.ts`)
- [x] Implement command parser and router (`src/cli/core/parser.ts`)
- [x] Create base command class (`src/cli/core/base-command.ts`)
- [x] Implement run commands (`src/cli/commands/run.command.ts`)
- [x] Implement setup commands (`src/cli/commands/setup.command.ts`)
- [x] Implement status commands (`src/cli/commands/status.command.ts`)
- [x] Implement create commands (`src/cli/commands/create.command.ts`)
- [x] Add CLI utilities (`src/cli/utils/`)
- [x] Update package.json bin configuration
- [ ] Add CLI tests
- [x] Update documentation

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [x] Code review completed
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] CLI integration working
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] Linting passes
- [x] Tested in dev environment
- [x] All commands executable via `testx` binary
- [x] Help system comprehensive and accurate

## Dependencies
- Commander.js (already in package.json)
- Chalk (already in package.json)
- Ora (already in package.json)
- Existing service integration system from Story 0.2

## Epic
**Epic:** Epic 0 - Foundation & Risk Mitigation

## Priority
**Priority:** P0 (Critical for MVP)

## Implementation Notes
- CLI should be the primary interface for all TestX operations
- Commands should integrate seamlessly with existing service integration system
- Error messages should be AI-friendly for debugging
- Support both interactive and non-interactive modes
- Implement proper signal handling for graceful shutdowns

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for each command class
- [ ] Integration tests for command execution
- [ ] CLI help system tests
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] Service integration tests via CLI

## Documentation Updates
- [x] Update README with CLI command examples
- [ ] Create CLI documentation in docs/cli.md
- [ ] Update troubleshooting docs with CLI error scenarios
