# TestX MVP - Cursor IDE Rules & Development Guidelines
# BMAD Method Enhanced - AI/Agent Optimized Development

## 🎯 Project Overview
- **Project:** TestX MVP - Professional browser testing framework
- **Architecture:** CLI-first, Module-based (ClientX, StaffX, AdminX)
- **Framework:** Playwright Test with TypeScript
- **Method:** BMAD (Business, Method, Architecture, Development)
- **Repository:** https://github.com/MDgoodlife/testx.git

## 🏗️ Core Building Rules (CRITICAL - READ FIRST)

### 1. Module-First Organization
- ALL code MUST be organized by module: `clientx`, `staffx`, `adminx`
- Each module has independent test suites, page objects, and configurations
- NO cross-module dependencies without explicit documentation
- File structure: `src/tests/{module}/`, `src/lib/pages/{module}/`

### 2. CLI-First Development
- ALL testing operations MUST be accessible via CLI
- Command pattern: `testx [action] [module] [scenario]`
- Examples: `testx run clientx auth`, `testx create clientx login-flow`
- Comprehensive error logging in CLI output for AI debugging

### 3. File Naming Conventions (STRICT)
- Test files: `{scenario}.spec.ts` (e.g., `login.spec.ts`)
- Page objects: `{page}.page.ts` (e.g., `auth.page.ts`)
- Setup files: `{module}-{type}.setup.ts` (e.g., `clientx-auth.setup.ts`)
- CLI commands: `{action}.command.ts` (e.g., `run.command.ts`)
- Config files: `{module}-{type}.json` (e.g., `clientx-scenarios.json`)

### 4. TypeScript Standards
- ALWAYS use TypeScript for all code
- Strict type checking enabled
- Interface definitions for all data structures
- No `any` types unless absolutely necessary with justification

### 5. Error Handling & Debugging
- ALL errors MUST be logged to CLI output with AI-friendly context
- Critical errors MUST be logged to Notion database
- Use structured error objects with context
- Include suggestions for resolution in error messages

## 🔄 Git Workflow & Branch Strategy

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready, stable code (protected)
- **dev**: Active development branch (default)
- **feature/{issue-number}-{short-description}**: Feature branches
- **hotfix/{issue-number}-{short-description}**: Critical fixes

### Commit Standards
- Use Conventional Commits: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- Examples:
  - `feat(cli): add testx run command for clientx module`
  - `fix(auth): resolve OAuth fallback mechanism`
  - `docs(readme): update installation instructions`

### Development Workflow
1. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/{issue-number}-{description}`
2. **Implement Changes**: Follow building rules and standards
3. **Test Locally**: Run relevant tests and ensure they pass
4. **Commit Changes**: Use conventional commit messages
5. **Push to Dev**: `git push origin feature/{branch-name}`
6. **Create PR**: Target `dev` branch, not `main`
7. **Code Review**: Wait for approval before merging
8. **Deploy to Dev**: Merge to `dev` branch after approval
9. **Human Approval**: Only deploy to `main` after human approval

## 🧪 Testing Standards

### Playwright Best Practices
- Use setup projects for authentication
- Implement page object models
- Isolate tests with independent auth states
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Enable trace collection for debugging

### Test Organization
- Group tests by user flow, not by page
- Use descriptive test names
- Include setup and teardown in test files
- Maintain test data independence

### Authentication Strategy
- Separate auth states per module: `clientx-user.json`, `staffx-admin.json`
- Use setup projects for auth state creation
- Implement fallback authentication mechanisms
- Test OAuth and email authentication flows

## 🔌 Integration Standards

### Slack Integration
- Summary notifications only (not detailed errors)
- Slash commands: `/testx run clientx auth`, `/testx status`
- Channel: #testx (C08U6H5DJGM)
- Error handling with graceful degradation

### Notion Integration
- Auto-create databases in TestX workspace
- Comprehensive logging for AI debugging
- Structured data for analytics
- Offline mode with sync capabilities

### GitHub Integration
- Manual deployment controls during MVP
- Automated testing on PR creation
- Branch protection on main
- Issue templates for consistent tracking

## 🤖 AI/Agent Development Rules

### Before Making Changes
1. Read `docs/project-rules.md` (this file)
2. Review `docs/folder-structure.md` for organization
3. Check existing patterns in similar modules/scenarios
4. Ensure changes follow established conventions

### When Adding New Features
1. Follow module-first organization
2. Add CLI command if user-facing
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Add error logging and validation
5. Test integration with existing systems

### When Debugging
1. Check CLI output for error context
2. Review Notion database for historical issues
3. Verify environment detection is working
4. Confirm authentication states are correct

### Documentation Requirements
- Every new feature MUST update relevant documentation
- AI agents MUST read project-rules.md before making changes
- All changes require clear commit messages
- Include examples in documentation

## 🚀 Development Commands

### Setup Commands
```bash
npm install                    # Install dependencies
npx playwright install        # Install browsers
npm run setup                 # Initialize integrations
```

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev                   # Start development mode
npm run test                  # Run all tests
npm run test:clientx          # Run ClientX tests only
npm run lint                  # Run linting
npm run type-check           # TypeScript type checking
```

### CLI Commands (Once Implemented)
```bash
testx run clientx auth        # Run ClientX auth tests
testx create clientx flow     # Create new test scenario
testx setup slack            # Setup Slack integration
testx status --global        # System health check
```

## 🔒 Security & Credentials

### Environment Variables
- Use `.env` for local development
- Never commit credentials to git
- Use `.env.example` for template
- Rotate test credentials regularly

### Authentication Testing
- Use dedicated test accounts for OAuth
- Implement credential rotation
- Secure storage of auth states
- Fallback mechanisms for service outages

2. **ALWAYS** test changes locally before pushing
3. **FOLLOW** the module-first organization strictly
4. **UPDATE** documentation with every change
5. **USE** conventional commits for all changes
6. **TEST** CLI commands after implementation
7. **VERIFY** integration health after changes
8. **MAINTAIN** backward compatibility during MVP

## 📞 Support & Escalation

### When Stuck
1. Check existing documentation
2. Review similar implementations
3. Test in isolation
4. Ask specific questions with context
5. Provide error logs and steps to reproduce

### Emergency Procedures
- Critical bugs: Create hotfix branch immediately
- Service outages: Activate fallback mechanisms
- Security issues: Stop development, assess impact
- Data loss: Restore from backups, document incident
