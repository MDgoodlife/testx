# Story: External Service Integration Sequence Definition

## User Story
**As a** TestX orchestrator  
**I want** a clearly defined integration setup sequence with dependencies  
**So that** external service integrations are reliable and properly ordered

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration dependency map created (Slack â†’ Notion â†’ GitHub)
- [ ] Service health check endpoints implemented for all external services
- [ ] Integration failure detection and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Service-specific fallback strategies (offline mode, cached data)
- [ ] Integration setup automation with dependency validation
- [ ] Clear error messages and troubleshooting guides for each service
- [ ] Integration testing with service outage simulation
- [ ] Rollback procedures for failed integrations

## Technical Requirements
- Service health monitoring
- Dependency validation logic
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Fallback data sources
- Integration state management

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Fallback scenarios tested
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

## Story Points
**Estimate:** 8
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)

## Dependencies
- None

## Epic
**Epic:** Epic 0: Foundation & Risk Mitigation

## Sprint
**Target Sprint:** Week 1

- [ ] User training materials for manual intervention scenarios
- [ ] Agent capability documentation and limitations
- [ ] Handoff procedures between user actions and agent automation

## Technical Requirements
- Documentation framework
- Interactive checklists
- Training materials
- Process flow diagrams

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved

# Story: Integration Failure Contingency Planning

## User Story
**As a** TestX system  
**I want** comprehensive contingency plans for external service failures  
**So that** testing can continue even when external dependencies are unavailable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Notion outage contingency plan (local database, file exports)
- [ ] GitHub outage contingency plan (local git, manual deployment)
- [ ] anyKrowd environment outage contingency plan (mock services, cached data)
- [ ] Network connectivity failure handling (offline mode, cached operations)
- [ ] Service degradation detection and automatic fallback activation
- [ ] Manual override procedures for critical operations
- [ ] Recovery procedures when services come back online

## Technical Requirements
- Service monitoring and health checks
- Fallback data sources
- Offline operation capabilities
- Manual override interfaces
- Recovery automation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Fallback scenarios tested
- [ ] Recovery procedures validated
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Documentation complete
